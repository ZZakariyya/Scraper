            "description": "money is weird, right? i was reading about tech founder vinay hiremath who left his company loom, giving up $60m. he wrote about feeling lost, trying to be like elon musk, breaking up with his girlfriend, and now he's just chilling in hawaii studying physics.\u00a0\n\nit got me thinking about all these rich people saying \"money won't make you happy.\" duh, i\u2019m not chasing happiness, i'm chasing freedom. i believe that money doesn\u2019t change an individual, it amplifies who you really are.\n\nif you're already kind, money makes you super kind. if you're a jerk, well... you become a bigger jerk. it's like a magnifying glass for your personality. that's why lottery winners usually end up broke - they got the money before becoming the right person.\n\nhere's something i've noticed: you don't get confidence from having a six-pack - you get it from being the kind of person who shows up at the gym every day. the weights don't get lighter, you get stronger.\n\nmoney is like a really good eraser. it won't write your happiness story for you, but it can erase a lot of the bad stuff. think about it - once you don't have to worry about rent or bills, you get to choose what makes you happy or sad.\u00a0\n\nbut there's a trap: we always want more. king solomon said: loving money means never having enough. it's like a treadmill - you keep running but never reach the end.\n\nmy takeaway? money itself isn't good or bad. it's just a tool that makes you more of who you already are. maybe the real trick is becoming the right person first, then letting the money follow\u2026",

I am so excited and honestly even though it\u2019s only 10$ which is how much I am charging that 10$ felt soooo muchhhh betterrrr than the several thousands of dollars I was making as a developer. \n\nEDIT:  For ppl asking what about my product, so lots of companies have support@ info@ privacy@ email addresses where customers usually ask questions, and request already available information and a lot of these emails are repetitive. \n\nI basically built an email chatbot for companies where they can use their own data (website, faq, schedules \u2026) and link their own support email account (e.g: info@somecompany) and whenever an inbound email is received it just automatically replies with the answer which significantly reduces the time spent replying to emails etc..\n\nIf the chatbot does not know the answer to something, or is not available in the data it will tell the customer/recipient that they\u2019ve forwarded their email to the team and will notify the company. It\u2019s essentially making a businesses support email account run on autopilot. \n\nAlso if anyone wants to connect maybe share advice I am on Twitter @ samihss ",

It's been 14 months and the vision is great but due to internal issues, we are shutting it down. Here are my learnings that I hope will help group members here.\n\n1. Pick your cofounders like you pick your spouse\n2. Unresolved conflicts will kill the startup faster than competition\n3. Leadership isn't about titles but it's about action\n4. Don't let one person hijack the company direction. Doesn't matter how senior he is\n5. Be wary if your cofounder overstates or misleads investors\n6. Never rely on verbal agreements\n7. Ensure legal and financial transparency from day one\n8. Don't ignore red flags in your co founders. You may think you can work around it but don't even try\n9. Keep a clear paper trail.\n10. Don't work with anyone who lacks integrity.\n\nIt's been hard shutting it down after so much of blood and sweat but I have to accept the reality of the situation.\n\nTaking a break now and then back to it again.

            "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been a longtime lurker in a bunch of entrepreneur subreddits and never really thought I\u2019d share anything about myself or my business, but I figured I might as well toss my own journey out there in case it helps someone realize that, yes, you really can do just about anything if you do your research and put in the work.\n\nBack in March, I decided to start an event rental business. Nothing fancy\u2014just tents, tables, chairs, and the occasional photo booth. My background is in engineering, but I\u2019ve always had side hustles in e-commerce and SEO (even made over 30k a month at one point, but that\u2019s a story for another day). After I did some research in my local area, I felt pretty confident I could beat most of the local competition, and I saw enough demand to fully jump into this new venture. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t do any ads, flyers, or even a boosted social post. Instead, I just built my website and focused on SEO to rank and to my surprise, it took off almost immediately. From March to September, I got over 450 inquiries.\n\nThe truth is, I wasn\u2019t prepared at all. I booked three events before I even had a tent, so I ended up dropping about $15k on equipment before May, when I had my first event. As inquiries kept pouring in, I spent another $15k on more equipment. Even then, I had to turn down more than half the events because I was fully booked for most of the summer.\n\nThat\u2019s when the real hustle began. I asked friends and family to help, and I hired a couple of college kids for part of the summer (it\u2019s hard finding seasonal employees). Sometimes I did the setups by myself, which is doable but definitely exhausting. To make things even crazier, I didn\u2019t have a truck, so I\u2019d rent one from Home Depot or U-Haul every week.\n\nEven with all the missed opportunities, I still cleared a bit over $110k in my first year. For those who like knowing the actual numbers, I only ended up netting around 40% after all the equipment, truck rentals, and help I had to pay for. It still feels wild, especially considering I never spent a single cent on advertising. It was all because of the website design and seo. One big lesson I learned, though, is that marketing can only take you so far if you\u2019re not ready to deliver. It was painful to realize I had money on the table that I couldn\u2019t grab because I just didn\u2019t have the capacity to handle it all.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share this to prove that if you do your research, and with some skill in web design and seo (YouTube university), you can definitely start a profitable business. Look around your area and figure out what people are searching for.\n\nThanks for reading. I hope this gives someone out there a little nudge if you\u2019re on the fence about starting something new. Feel free to ask any questions\u2014I\u2019ve learned so much from this community, and I\u2019d love to pay it forward.",

            "description": "Last year, I was pressure washing part-time on weekends and made around $65K. This year, I went full-time and am on track to break six figures. I didn\u2019t have any special background\u2014just learned from YouTube, Facebook groups, and trial and error. Now I run my own ads, manage my website, and handle everything myself.\n\nThe biggest lessons I\u2019ve learned:\n\n* **Commercial work is the real money maker** \u2013 Residential is nice, but landing just a few commercial contracts can keep your schedule full without constantly chasing new customers.\n* **Google Ads and yard signs print money** \u2013 I wasted time on things like handing out flyers when I should\u2019ve gone harder on paid ads and strategic signage early on.\n* **Pricing too low is the fastest way to burn out** \u2013 When I first started, I undercharged, thinking it would help me get more clients. It only made me work harder for less and attracted price shoppers.\n* **Networking beats cold calls** \u2013 Getting in with property managers, business owners, and other contractors has led to some of my biggest jobs.\n\nI know a lot of people in this sub are looking for side hustles or ways to scale small businesses. If you\u2019re thinking about starting a service business, pressure washing is one of the easiest and most profitable ones out there. If you\u2019re already in the industry or just curious, I\u2019ve been sharing my experiences in a group  where a lot of pressure washers talk about their wins, struggles, and best strategies.

But no one really talks about:\n\n* The *hustle* just to keep a business alive.\n* The long hours that wear you down.\n* The bad partnerships, getting screwed over.\n* The high overhead costs, the stress of paying employees.\n* The fact that some months, you barely make enough to cover rent.\n\nEntrepreneurship is sold as the ultimate freedom, but for a lot of people, it starts to feel like the opposite. That\u2019s why CNBC and LinkedIn News picked up my story\u2014because *this is real life.*\n\nI\u2019m not saying quitting is the answer for everyone. But if you\u2019re in the trenches right now, questioning if the grind is even worth it, just know\u2014it\u2019s okay to pivot. Choosing stability and peace of mind doesn\u2019t mean you failed.\n\nShoutout to this Reddit community\u2014this is where I first opened up about all of this, and the response was incredible. Thank you for keeping it real.\n\nNot dropping any links, but if anyone wants to check out the CNBC or LinkedIn stories, happy to share in the comments.",

            "description": "Being a solo founder can be isolating. Your friends might not understand what you\u2019re building, your family could dismiss it as just a phase, and some days, even you question if you\u2019re on the right path. It\u2019s tough, and the weight of it all can make you crave a partner to share the load. But here\u2019s the thing, don\u2019t let that loneliness push you into finding a co-founder you don\u2019t truly need.\n\nToo often, people bring on co-founders for roles that could easily be hired out, only to regret giving away equity when things get messy down the line. \n\nThe truth is, building something worthwhile takes patience. Resist the urge to make emotional decisions. Focus on the long game, your business will thank you later.  ",

            "description": "TL;DR: PM of 5 months wants 40% of my business and I don't know what to do.\n\nHello!\nI am having a bit of an issue, and I can't seem to figure out the best solution, partly due to my extremely agreeable character, and partly due to my inexperience.\n\nA bit of context: I'm a 24 years old guy from Texas, and I started my (first) company 9 months ago, which is about custom data analytics software.\n\nI hired 3 developers, and after around 4 months, due to being overwhelmed I decided to hire a PM.\nHe is much more experienced than me, 20 years older, well spoken and quite capable.\n\nHe offered himself to work with me at a much lower rate than his usual, so I took the chance.\n\nI have to admit that over the past 5 months, he helped quite a bit reorganizing the work and increasing our rates.\n\nHe also helped finding new developers that we needed. \n\n(Small parenthesis about this last thing, turns out that he has his own small recruitment agency, which I didn't know about, and so he takes a percentage from the people i found through him. I found out because a developer told me accidentally, I confronted him and he said he did not mean to hide it from me it just didn't come out)\n\nAnyways, fast forward to now, he is saying he would like to become partner and COO, and he would like to become a contributing partner for 40% of the company.\n\nI should add that he mentioned that, since he knows I lost quite a lot of money on this, I first should recoup my investment and make some money, and then become partner with him.\n\nHe just would like to make sure we sign sooner rather than later, to avoid the company becoming very profitable and me deciding not to later on, after he put a bunch of effort in.\n\nNote that the company is barely profitable now, netting around 5k a month for the first time.\n\nI personally feel like 40% is too much, and I have so many doubts, but I definitely recognize he is a valuable person in the company.\n\nOn the other side, he is involved with quite a few businesses, so he probably won't have nearly as much time as me to put in.\n\nOkay so, finally, these are my doubts:\n\nFirst of all, does he expect me to \"gift\" the partnership to him or is he going to pay for it?\n\nSecond of all, what percentage would be appropriate?\n\nThird question: should I even give him a percentage? Is there anything I should know before committting, and am I making a mistake?\n\nThe worst thing is that I feel like my judgement is impaired by how agreeable and shy I am, and so I don't know how to make an objective decision.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: company rn is valued at 200k, and in a year, based on our client acquisition rate and churn rate, it could be 700k-1mln.\n\nEdit 2: He has not brought any work in.\n\nEdit 3: He is not asking for it right now, he wants to sign soon but get it after I make money on it as well",

            "description": "I've been a startup Founder since 1994 when I started my first company at 19.\u00a0 Since then I've started 9 companies and exited 5.\u00a0 The last exit was last year.\u00a0 I'm trying to provide some backstory without getting into who I am - you can dig into that on your own if you want, but it's not necessary.\n\n\u00a0I wanted to share what a life looks like when every time you can choose between \"The Safe Route\" and the \"Totally Stupid Idea\" ... you always pick the latter.\u00a0 I think part of this is because we all struggle with the \"What if...\" and often romanticize that outcome.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Here are some milestones where I had to make those choices, what I did, and how it turned out.\u00a0 Some of you are dealing with exactly these choices, so I want to provide some color from one point of view on how I thought about it.\n\n\u00a01. I dropped out of college\n\nLook, I sucked as a student, which is kind of ironic bc I'm basically paid to be a teacher. When I was 19, in 1994 I realized that this new thing called \"The Internet\" would be a big deal and I could charge companies money to build something called a \"Web Site\".\u00a0 When I told my guidance counselor that I was dropping out of school to start \"an Internet company\" she looked at my incredulously and said \"What's the Internet?!\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Needless to say she wasn't supportive of my decision.\u00a0 Nor was any other person in my life whatsoever.\u00a0 You have to remember that back then the idea of young Founders wasn't anything like it is today.\u00a0 I had no idea if this interactive agency thing had legs, I just knew that I hated school and was essentially unemployable.\u00a0 So I went all in.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The reason I think it worked isn't because the agency went on to be successful.\u00a0 It worked because I knew in my gut that working for someone else, or more specifically not having complete agency of my life (no matter what it paid) was all I really cared about.\u00a0 That ended up being the defining characteristic of my life thereafter.\u00a0 It was immutable, even though every voice around me told me otherwise.\n\n\u00a02. I left my own company before IPO\n\n\u00a0The agency I started go merged with another agency, I joined the board and served as the CEO of the interactive part and we grew that company to $700m in billings in 7 years.\u00a0 At that point we were prepping for an IPO.\u00a0 In 2001 we were approached by Dan Snyder (yes the Washington Commanders owner) to purchase the agency and we sold it in 2002 with the understanding that we'd take it public past the sale.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0At that point I had the option of working at the agency and going through the IPO or leaving altogether.\u00a0 I quit well before any of that happened.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 I hated working at an agency.\u00a0 It pays well, but service work is insanely thankless (if you do well, no one cares, if you fuck up, clients are all up your ass) and we were working with clients that paid well, but didn't inspire me.\u00a0 I was 27.\n\n\u00a0I left a LOT of money on the table.\u00a0 My business partner stayed on, took the company IPO, and made gobs of cash.\u00a0 What he endured to get it was insane, and I respect him so much.\u00a0 In the 20+ years since I have spent about 9 seconds worrying about whether or not I made the right decision.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I would have made more money, but I would have eaten up some of the most exciting years of my life (late 20s, early 30s) slaving for clients I didn't enjoy with a mission I simply didn't care about (btw, that's also unfair to everyone I worked with).\u00a0 I valued my freedom over the money, and looking back I realize it was an incredible win for my life, not so much my wallet ;)\n\n\u00a03. I clashed with VCs over running my company\n\n\u00a0This has a lot more backstory than I can offer here, but the short version is I seed funded my first (funded) startup with a bunch of well known backers like Bessemer, Founder's Fund, and notably in this case Mark Suster (before he became a VC, he personally invested).\u00a0 Mark was very adamant when we started the company (same concept as what Affirm is now, only years before them) that I only focus on this one thing, and nothing else.\n\n\u00a0He said that what good Founders do is focus on a single, funded opportunity and just pursue that.\u00a0 Did I follow Mark's advice?\u00a0 No - I did pretty much the opposite.\u00a0 Instead I started 4 other companies, 2 of which I self-funded and 2 of which I venture funded.\u00a0 It... did not go well with investors.\n\n\u00a0VCs are very used to have a large degree of control over their funded Founders and with me, they had none of this, and it really pissed them off.\u00a0 To be clear - that was MY fault, not theirs.\u00a0 I was kind, but I really don't like being told what to do (hence my career choice).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Because of that, and other reasons, we had very \"meh\" outcomes on all of the funded companies.\u00a0 No big losses, but no big wins.\u00a0 It was 100% my fault.\u00a0 Maybe had I focused on just one company like Mark said, it would have been more successful.\u00a0 Maybe not.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0But my goal was to build a portfolio of startups, because I wanted the agency to work on lots of things in parallel because that's where my heart and interest lies.\u00a0 What I learned from that experience, which actually helped me, was that I could still pursue that path (what I'm doing now) but I'd have to do it without investors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0It's kind hard to be in the startup game and not wonder whether or not we should have pursued investment.\u00a0 So I took both paths (some funded, some not) at the same time for over a decade (I would highly recommend this to no one) and learned through tears and panic attacks, that being a funded founder isn't for me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0... well, this got way longer than I expected so hopefully there are a few parallels that some of you can pull from this.\u00a0\n\nHappy to dig in on any of those points and expand a bit.\u00a0",

            "description": "Hey guys, just wrote something for those of you unsure whether your idea has some potential to be a great business. \n\n\n\nI founded two profitable SaaS companies without VC money (I won't tell you which one. because this post is not about that). In building those, I used four rules to evaluate their potential to succeed.\n\n\n\nBasically, I created a little framework to minimize the risk of failure. \n\n\n\nThe statistic that 90% of startups fail has been around for decades, but I don't think it's entirely true. \n\n\n\nIt may be true for VC-backed startups that must turn into a Billion dollar company or die. But fuck that!\n\n\n\nThe Silicon Valley way is not the only game in town. \n\n\n\nThe framework:\n\n\n\nI called it \"The most unambitious way to build a startup\" because you will not change the world. The returns won't be as outlandish. \n\n\n\nBut if you're looking to build a business that changes your own world, this might be an interesting read.\n\n\n\nHere are my four rules: \n\n1) **Is it B2B**? This is where the money is  \n2) I**s there a competitor making bank**? Good! There is a market  \n3) I**s there one angle to outcompete your competitor**? This could be support, pricing, or features.   \n4) **Are there SEO opportunities**? People need to find out about you. For me, this is SEO, but it could be sales, partnerships, etc., or whatever your jam for growth is. \n\n\n\nI wrote more in-depth about how I applied it to my businesses before I started in my newsletter today. I'm not sure if I can link here, but its called 1millionarrsubstack (dot) com\n\n\n\nHope you get something out of it! \n\nCheers,  \nIron",

            "description": "Hello, I'm new in business (around 8 months), I've started with media product (completely non scalable) then switched to Mobile apps\u00a0\n\nAnd right now I have around 700 DAU, 10k downloads. But I don't have even a $2k revenue a month I don't understand how is it possible to grow this from Small business to a big one. Yes, I can continue to create more assets, but what will I achieve? 2-3 years of hard work and $10-20k in the the best scenario?\u00a0\n\nI'm constantly wanna switch to another venture, like maybe to try B2B or SaaS models, or even start Ecommerce idk, this is a constant urge because I can't understand how people do big business and thinking that my field is too hard for me\n\nI constantly see huge guys who do like $1M+ a month in other fields, that's insane for me\n\nalso:  \n\\- I live in the village  \n\\- I have only online, I can't search for Offline idea business because the place is so small for growth  \n\n\nWhat I've understood about big business, one of these directions:\u00a0  \n1. Large market + big change + strong team\u00a0  \n2. Something new, useful, and unique that even without a strong team, you can compete  \n3. Compound interest in a niche (old market, slow growth)  \n4. Startup with Investment option, large-scale idea + cofounder with niche experience  \n5. Go to big business through M&A, creating + selling + buying assets. And eventually maybe reach a big business.  \n6. Agency / Studio ?\u00a0  \n7. Grow a huge network, communicate only with big players -> but then luck, in general. Not my case  \n8. Doing business where there is a high exchange rate (or transaction size), + large purchasing power (financial markets, E-Commerce, real estate, cars, etc.)\n\nBut what's stops me idk, maybe amount of work and not a clear vector of what to choose next. I don't want to waste a time anymore, I have 1-2 years to make a fundament. And yet already all January I didn't find any new product idea, I was in search of business partner and at the end each person just wanted to start his own direction or just ignored me. Mobile apps business is so difficult and draining me a lot. Because I am alone and I need to make big product (1-2 months) and then spending 2-3 months on marketing + it could fail easily. And not only one product, but many in the future and idk how will I do it alone (I don't have enough revenue to hire anyone)\n\nSo business friends, a difficult situation, would love to hear any advices or hear your story how did you start doing big business",

            "description": "After helping dozens of founders build MVPs and launching several products myself, I've noticed something counterintuitive: The most successful SaaS products often come from non-technical founders with deep industry experience.\n\n\n\nWhy? Because they have something more valuable than technical skills - domain expertise.\n\n\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\n\n\nThe Common Startup Path:\n\n1. Learn to code\n\n2. Build a product\n\n3. Search for a problem it solves\n\n4. Try to find customers\n\n\n\nThe Domain Expert Path:\n\n1. Deeply understand industry problems\n\n2. Already know what customers will pay for\n\n3. Have existing relationships in the market\n\n4. Build (or get help building) the solution\n\n\n\nThe Key Advantages of Domain Experts:\n\n\n\n1. Problem Validation\n\n\\- You already know what solutions have failed\n\n\\- You understand why they failed\n\n\\- You know exactly what people would pay to solve\n\n\n\n2. Market Understanding\n\n\\- You speak the industry language\n\n\\- You know where your customers hang out\n\n\\- You understand their buying process\n\n\n\n3. Trust & Network\n\n\\- You have credibility in your space\n\n\\- You can get honest feedback easily\n\n\\- You have potential first customers\n\n\n\nThe Myth That Stops Many Experts:\n\n\"I need to learn to code\" or \"I need a technical co-founder\"\n\n\n\nThe Truth:\n\nTechnical skills can be learned or hired. Domain expertise takes years to build.\n\n\n\nMy Advice for Domain Experts:\n\n1. Start with your expertise, not with technology\n\n2. Focus on the problem you want to solve\n\n3. Validate with real potential customers\n\n4. Keep your solution focused and lean\n\n5. Get technical help when you have validation\n\n\n\nThe hardest part of building a successful SaaS isn't the coding - it's knowing what to build. And you already know that.\n\n\n\nWould love to hear from other domain experts who've made this transition. What challenges did you face?",

I was mainly providing web development services and I specialized in developing e-commerce solutions.\n\nIn that period and till 2019, I was launching a product after another, some of them make a light success and most of them failed, but the good part I was not stopping for any reason from building and launching new products.\n\nIn May 2019, a talent acquisition hunter reached out offering me backend developer position, which seems very interesting, especially that it was a new and well funded startup. I decided to give it try, thinking I will learn a lot about entrepreneurship.\n\nI joined the company, and I must confess, I have learned a lot on both technical and management side, but unfortunately, I got used to the income safety, but most importantly, in somehow, I lost entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nAfter spending 3 years and a half in that company, I moved to a new country where I have no network in. I tried to find a job in the IT field, but it was really hard especially with hiring philosophy here. So I wanted to get back to entrepreneurship.\n\nUnfortunately, I found myself following the same working pattern in companies: Thinking, Planning, Starting, Not finishing, Start looking for 9-5 job and LOOP.\n\nEverytime I try to build a product, I found myself doing planning instead of doing.",

            "description": "Reddit has become a major force in how people make buying decisions. Last year, they partnered with Google in a $60 million deal, letting Google use Reddit content directly in search results. OpenAI also partnered with Reddit for AI training data, making Reddit content show up more in AI search results.\n\nYou might have already noticed a trend in Reddit threads ranking in the top 10 for all kinds of searches. Now when you look up product reviews or software recommendations, you often see Reddit threads at the top of Google results.\n\nGoogle is actively pushing traffic toward Reddit because people trust other people's discussions more than traditional blog content. When people want real opinions about products, they skip review sites and head straight to Reddit. Many of us even add \"Reddit\" to our Google searches to find real information.\n\n**Here's why this matters for your business:**\n\n* Your customers see Reddit posts first when they search for solutions. They're most likely making buying decisions based on these discussions right now\n* These Reddit threads stay at the top of Google for months. That means free, ongoing exposure for your business if you're part of the threads\n* When people search for your competitors or alternatives, they find Reddit threads. You want to be in these conversations to show how your solution is different\n* Both Google and OpenAI now use Reddit content everywhere - search results, AI answers, and product recommendations. If you're not posting about your business on Reddit, you're invisible.\n\nReddit isn't just another social platform anymore. With Google and OpenAI pushing Reddit content, it's become the first place people go to research products and make buying decisions. If you're not part of these conversations, you're missing out on customers who are actively looking for solutions like yours.",

            "description": "I made a post last week and it blew up so thought I'd follow up after a week. I can't link it unfortunately so if you'd like to see it, please look at my profile or just copy/paste the title into the search bar. \n\nQuick refresher:\n\nMy brother came up with an idea involving reselling a niche good a few years ago. I took the idea, ran with it, made a good amount of money without him helping at all BESIDES the idea itself. My brother saw some changes in the market + was uncomfortable?, got upset, told me and my business partner to stop. And that left me in a weird spot: do I stop, or do I continue?\n\nBefore going onto the update, I think I left a few things out in my first post that may help clarify my situation.\n\n1. I want to reiterate that I would never have come up with this business idea on my own. It's not like some tech startup idea that's popular; this is a really niche idea and a really niche market. Adding anyone into the market will affect it somewhat\n\n2. When I first started working on this business, I told my brother immediately and he congratulated my success. All seemed well and I had even mentioned to my brother that if it ever turned south and he was starting to get affected by me being in the same market, I would get out and respect that he started in the market himself\n\n3. Right before making this aforementioned post, I actually agreed to stop. Told him that we would get out of the market within 6 months. Immediately felt bad about that decision though, so I came back a few days later and told him that we needed to talk. I didn't mention this in my original post because I was pretty embarrassed about flipping decisions. I think I was being influenced a lot by my brother, parents etc. But, this may help explain the below...\n\nNow, onto the updates. I am currently on a ski trip with my family and finally talked with my brother today in person about the issue and we argued a bunch. He mentioned he was annoyed that I took his idea and that he was feeling pressure within the market. While he did say he was making the same amount of money as before, he mentioned that it was much more difficult to do so - and as such, it was making his life more difficult.\n\nI said that I thought he wasn't being respectful to me and the time I put in by asking me to stop point blank. I thought that he was attributing too much of our business to just solely his idea and not recognizing how much effort/time we had to put in to get where we were. \n\nAfter a lot of talking, we eventually came to an agreement that he would get a certain percentage of our business TBD after I would talk it over with my business partner in a few days.\n\nA few hours later, my brother decided to tell my parents about our conversation which turned everything into a whole mess. My mom and dad seemed disapointed in me - to me, at least, they seemed to be on my brother's side. They did say, however, that they understood both sides and offered a few alternatives.\n\nThe first - that I offered a percentage of the business to my brother PLUS that I couldn't engage in any other business that was tangential to his idea. The second - that he gave me some time (about a year) to continue with the business, then after that point I had to leave BUT could continue to operate any business that was tangential to his original idea.\n\nA lot of complicated stuff. Still is a pretty difficult situation. Most of you told me last post to just say fuck you to him but I can't do that. He's my brother, I love him a lot and I don't want to do anything that will hurt him. I just want to get to a point where my needs meet his happiness; and right now, it seems difficult to meet both of those criteria...",

If you are selling dresses, the strategy might still work, but more you'd have to adapt to your own platform.\n\n1. Firstly we identified who our ideal customers were (ICP). These were engineering leaders at tech startups based in United States. Once I identified this, I used Apollo to find these people using the ICP filters\n2. Then both my co-founder and I added about 100 of these people every week using LinkedIn Premium. With the the connect request, we added a small note that went like\"Hey- this is X founder of Y. We are solving X by doing Y. Interested in a quick chat?\"\n3. If they replied, we would instantly send a Calendly and get on a call within 2 days.\n4. If they did not reply, we kept engaging them by following atleast 2 posts every week that would show up on their feed\n   1. On Tuesdays, it was a short form post that was mostly learning from experience like \"5 Mistakes We Made During our First Hire\", which had nothing to do our product mostly\n   2. On Thursdays, we shared a company blog that was relevant directly to our customers. We mostly just used AI tools to generate these. Its less about quality, but more about consistency.\n5. Slowly but steadily, my connects started ending up on our landing page, using our \"Schedule Demo\" button to schedule more calls.\n6.

            "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nJust wanted to share a pretty big life update. Last Friday was my final day at my corporate job after an amazing 7-year journey. It wasn't an easy decision, especially with a family to support, but I've decided to go all in on my lead generation agency.\n\nI've been running it as a side hustle for a while now, and it's been doing well (well enough that I know it deserves my full attention). The past few months have shown me that I need to make this leap if I want to take it to the next level.\n\nMy time in sales taught me so much about building relationships and understanding what businesses really need. It's funny how life works. Those skills ended up being the foundation for my agency's success.\n\nI'm both excited and nervous (honestly, mostly nervous lol), but seeing the results we've been getting for clients so far makes me confident this is the right move. \n\nI'll probably post updates as this journey continues. If anyone here is struggling with lead generation or wants to chat about scaling their business, my DMs are open. Not trying to sell anything, just happy to share what I've learned so far!",

The more content you post, the more reach you get. This works for entertainment, but for educational content, it\u2019s misleading. A real expert with 10+ years of experience might get less engagement than someone with an older account or a better hook.\n\n\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t just their lack of knowledge\u2014it\u2019s the hype. They write catchy titles, exaggerate everything, and mislead people just to sell a product or get more engagement.\n\nA few examples:\n\n* **\u201cAI will replace developers tomorrow\u201d** \u2013 Even if AI becomes incredibly advanced in terms of engineering (it can code now, but it is not at the level of an engineer), it\u2019s still far from replacing engineers. I wrote a post about this.\n* **\u201cNo-code and low-code can build great apps\u201d** \u2013 If you rated app complexity from 1 to 100, no-code and low-code tools can build apps under level 5. Non-experts don\u2019t understand how complex real apps are. They see AI generate a landing page and assume building Uber is just a bit harder. I\u2019ll write a detailed post on this soon.\n\nSocial media makes misinformation spread fast. Be careful what advice you follow.",

            "description": "Yesterday, while having coffee with a friend, we ended up talking about dreams. \u201cWhat do you really want to do?\u201d he asked me. It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve faced countless times, with different people, at different moments. But the answer, inevitably, always comes down to the same thing:\n\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s just a dream. It\u2019s not for us. Some people are meant for that, and then there\u2019s us\u2026 just regular people.\u201d\n\nThis sentence has stuck with me my whole life.\n\nAs a kid, I loved playing football. And like every child, I dreamed big. I imagined myself in a huge stadium, the crowd cheering, my friends and family in the stands rooting for me. I dreamed of being the best, of hearing people say, \u201cWow, you\u2019re incredible!\u201d\n\nBut the reality was that the voices around me kept repeating the same thing:\n\n\u201cImpossible. The people you see on TV were born that way, with special talent. You\u2026 you\u2019re just an average kid.\u201d\n\nEven now, it still stings just to write it. Maybe I wasn\u2019t as good as I thought, maybe I never would have become a champion. But that\u2019s not the point. Hearing those words over and over made me give up before I even had a real chance to try.\n\nYears have passed, but the feeling is still the same.\n\nEvery time I talk about my dreams, the response I get is always some version of the same idea:\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get a normal job? Go out on weekends, have drinks with friends, take a summer trip to the nearest beach, and every now and then, buy yourself some new gadget so you can finally stop writing all that weird code on your PC. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n*NO. Absolutely not.*\n\nWait, hold on. I know what you might be thinking. \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Or maybe, \u201cWho are you, some rich kid who can afford to dream big?\u201d\n\nSorry to disappoint you, but no. There\u2019s no big bank account waiting for me. And no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that kind of life. In fact, many of the people I know live exactly like that, and they\u2019re probably happy.\n\nBut not me.\n\nI want more. I want to push beyond the average. To do more, to achieve more. And yes, I get it, taking risks, pushing boundaries, trying to go beyond what\u2019s safe can be a crazy thing to do.\n\nAnd yet, for the first time, I\u2019m actually testing this belief. For months, I\u2019ve been working on something of my own, a project that at first seemed like just another idea, one of those that usually gets left in a drawer. But not this time. This time, I stuck with it, despite the doubts, despite the fear of failing. And this Sunday\u2026 this Sunday, it\u2019s finally happening. I\u2019m launching it publicly.\n\nYou only live once, and time moves faster than it seems.\n\nSo yes. This time, I\u2019m taking the leap.",

            "description": "The other day, I was reading *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\**ck, and one of the ideas that hit me hard was how it shifts your perspective on some common struggles. One theme that really resonated with me, and one I\u2019m deeply connected to, is failure.\n\nThere\u2019s a line in the book that says, \u201c*Failure is the way forward\u201d.* To me, that means failure is an essential part of growth. But is it really? I\u2019m only 25, but I\u2019ve encountered failure more times than I can count. I can tell you about giving up my dream of playing football. I can tell you about those moments of pressure I couldn\u2019t handle. I can tell you about all the mistakes I made throughout university. But honestly, that would be boring, right? Plus, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all faced similar failures in our own journeys.\n\nBut ask yourself: *Has it truly helped you grow?* Because, for the life of me, I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s made a real difference for me.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I decided to do: I decided to bet everything on failure. At the start of 2025, I made a promise to myself, one I\u2019m about to repeat here. **1 year. 12 months. 365 days. No more.** That\u2019s the deadline I\u2019ve set for chasing my dreams. After that, I\u2019ll turn to the more \u201cpractical\u201d stuff, the things that everyone says are \u201cwithin my reach.\u201d No one imposed this deadline on me. No one told me that if I don\u2019t hit my goals by 2026, I won\u2019t be worthy of continuing. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve self imposed, and I believe it\u2019ll push me in those moments when I just want to sit on the couch and binge TV.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re about to comment, *\u201cBut things aren\u2019t that simple. Maybe it takes more time. Maybe you need to try for another 10 or 20 years\u201d,* hold up. What I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019ve already lost years and missed opportunities chasing this dream. I know that things don\u2019t happen overnight, and the path is never linear.\n\nThe point is, this year, I want to dedicate everything I have, my strengths, my weaknesses, all of it, to making this happen. And if that means more failure, then I\u2019m READY to accept it and face it head on. I\u2019m ready to fail and rise again, every single time.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why, in exactly 6 days, I\u2019m launching my first app ***postonreddit***. I\u2019m hoping that all the work I\u2019ve put into it wasn\u2019t for nothing, that the time and effort I\u2019ve invested will lead to something meaningful. But if it doesn\u2019t? Then I\u2019m ready to fail, learn, and start again, one more time.",

Instead, they clicked *\u201csee an example\u201d* and didn\u2019t engage further.\n* **Monetization isn\u2019t clear yet** \u2013 I planned to charge later, but I\u2019m still figuring out **how to transition free users into paying ones.**\n\n# What I\u2019d Do Differently\n\n* **Test email deliverability earlier** to make sure outreach actually reaches people.\n* **Guide first-time users better**\u2014maybe incentivize them to enter their own book passage instead of just browsing.\n* **Experiment with paid plans sooner**, even in a beta phase.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m focused on **getting real engagement**\u2014not just signups. For those of you who\u2019ve built an MVP, **how did you get users to actually engage and not just sign up?**",

These tips are simple, budget-friendly, and effective if you\u2019re consistent.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a big budget to get started in SEO, but it does take time and effort.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s worked:\n\n# Quick Wins: Start Small\n\n* **Write Blog Posts** Publish 1\u20132 blog posts weekly targeting specific keywords. Use free tools like Google Keyword Planner or affordable ones like Keywords Everywhere. Focus on helpful, actionable content.\n* **Share on Social Media** Post your blogs on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. These no-follow backlinks won\u2019t directly boost rankings but they play important role in brand mention, post indexing, can drive traffic + visibility.\n* **Submit to Directories, Launch Platforms and Create Profile on Popular Platforms** Add your product to directories like Alternative To, Launch on platforms like Product Hunt, and Create profile on popular platforms like Crunchbase. It\u2019s tedious taks but worthy for initial visibility and backlinks.\n* **Broken Link Building** Find broken links in your niche using tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush. Create replacement content and reach out to site owners suggesting your link as a fix.\n* **Unlinked Brand Mentions** Track mentions of your brand with tools like Google Alerts. Ask site owners to add a link back to your site.\n* **Ask for Backlinks** Reach out to partners, suppliers, or customers for backlinks. Offer testimonials or case studies in exchange.\n\n# High-Quality Backlinks: The Next Step\n\n* **Guest Blogging** Pitch guest post ideas to blogs in your niche (e.g. search \u201cyour niche + write for us\u201d). Focus on blogs with good traffic and authority.\n* **Competitor Backlink Analysis** Use tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush to see where competitors get backlinks. Reach out to those sites with better content or offers.\n* **Content Updates & Outreach** Find outdated content in your niche, create updated versions, and suggest webmasters link to yours instead of the old one.\n* **Resource Page Link Building** Search for resource pages in your industry (e.g., \u201cyour niche + resources\u201d) and pitch your content as a valuable addition.\n* **Skyscraper Technique** Identify top-performing content using Ahrefs, create something better, and ask sites linking to the original to link to yours instead.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear what\u2019s worked for you.",

            "description": "I quit my last corporate job at the end of 2022\u2026 a decision followed by an overwhelming feeling of \u201cwhat have I done?\u201d\n\nSince then I started 2 businesses.\n\nOne payments biz got to 250K in GMV in 6 months, then died. The other is a services business currently running at a modest $7K / month, 3 months in.\n\nI recently re-read my 2 year old thinking on why I took the leap.\n\nMy thinking has evolved since then.\n\nThings definitely do not go how you think you\u2019re gonna go.\n\nI know some of your reading this are thinking about taking the leap. I\u2019m lookin at you.\n\nHere are 11 uncomfortable realities about entrepreneurship I learned after the fact:\n\n1. Unscalable services are the fastest way to generate cash. New founders won\u2019t listen to me, but don\u2019t start with a product business.\n2. There is an ocean of skill-acquisition between you and what you want. Your corporate job doesn\u2019t train you to take people\u2019s money. The biggest ones are opportunity selection, lead generation, sales, and delegation. Each beasts unto themselves.\n3. You will suck for a long time because you\u2019re instantly a beginner at everything you\u2019re doing. Look at it like a flight of stairs. One day you\u2019ll wake up and be like \u201cwow I\u2019m kinda good at this\u201d. Patience and cash-generation help.\n4. 100% of things are highly competitive. Accept it and don\u2019t let the mere existence of competition discourage you.\n5. No one will take you seriously at first. This includes friends, family, customers, and vendors.\n6. Free work is a requirement to get going. Swallow your ego and build social proof.\n7. Most people can\u2019t help. Move from warm to cold outbound quickly.\n8. Be prepared to pay for help. It\u2019s silly not to. Would you try to become a great tennis player without a coach?\n9. 100% of business ideas have a reason to not do them. Make a judgement call, validate quickly, and be prepared to move to the next thing.\n10. Learning is a foregone conclusion and should not drive your decision-making. \u201caT LeAsT We\u2019LL LeArN sOmEtHiNg\u201d. No. You\u2019re going to learn regardless. Will the business make money?\n\nAnd finally, entrepreneurship is a bad choice if you want to optimize for being happy all the time.\n\nAnyone disagree?",

I\u2019m seriously considering a move down south to either Florida or Texas where the market is less affected by winter slowdowns and there's a steady demand year around.\n\nI\u2019ve seen content (like a recent YouTube feature on how cleaning businesses are dominating in Florida) that highlights the advantages of operating in warmer climates, and it got me thinking about how location can be a game changer.\n\nA few questions I\u2019d love any of your input on:\n\n* **Benchmarks:** For a solopreneur starting out, what monthly revenue or profit targets should I be aiming for? I\u2019m aware some claims (like hitting $9K per month) may not be entirely realistic without a full team.\n* **Market Positioning:** Should I target a high-end client base for recurring work or focus on volume? How do you balance pricing to ensure quality service while keeping the business sustainable?\n* **Relocation Insights:** For those who\u2019ve made the leap from a seasonal market (like up north) to a more stable one down south. what challenges and advantages have you experienced?",

            "description": "Since \"How do I get started?\" questions are so common here, I thought I would share my perspective on a lot of posts on here.  Failure is frequently talked about, because let's face it, most small businesses don't make it.  The one thing I see frequently here is that a lot of people aren't fully committed to their business idea, and I think that's problem #1.  \n\n  \nBusiness takes commitment and risk.  If you've tried 10 different ideas and none of them are working, it's probably because you aren't 100% committed to any of them.  I had 1 business idea and I 100% committed to it.  If it failed, my family would be homeless.  I put everything into it, it was my only source of livelihood.  Scrapping it and trying something else a few months later was never an option.  If you've \"tried 7 or 8 things and most have failed\" it's probably because you aren't committed to any of them.  You can't be completely passionate about 7 or 8 different things, you're just dabbling in different things at that point. And with no commitment to it, I guarantee it'll fail.  Working another job while starting it wasn't an option, there's no way to put 80 hours a week into something new if you're still working 40 hours a week at a regular job.  We sold our house and moved our family of 4 into the room above my parent's garage to save money so we could start the business.  We lived there for almost a year, sleeping on mattresses on the floor in a single room.  Me, my wife, 5 year old son and 12 year old daughter.  We made it work.  I sold my truck, and me and my wife shared her car.  I had a lot of woodworking stuff, I loved building furniture, I sold every bit of it because I needed the money for the business, and I didn't have time to build furniture anymore anyways.  I'm not patting myself on the back, I'm just saying this is how A LOT of successful business owners did it.  I'd love to hear from others who have a similar story, I bet it's a lot more common than you think. \n\n\n\nAnd if you aren't willing to give it 80 hours a week in the very beginning, its probably not going to make it. I gave it everything I had, 100% all in, and it paid off.  It was rough in the beginning, we were behind on our mortgage a few months, and couldn't afford Christmas presents for our kids one year, but by a couple years in we were really making some money, and it's been nothing but growth ever since.  \n\n\n\nI know everyone's situations are different, and there are always exceptions to everything, but don't try to start a business if you're not ready to jump in head first.  Trying to stand on the dock and dip your toes in doesn't work.  I see so many posts about people who have been \"starting a business\" for years while still working their day job.  95% of them will never get it launched.  A huge part of starting a business is figuring out how to actually get it going, and being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to do it.  If you really go for it, and you fail, you're pretty screwed.  But if you succeed, holy crap, it's amazing.  Welcome to entrepreneurship.    ",

            "description": "I work with thousands of early stage Founders and one of the most common concerns they voice in the formative stages is **\"I'm afraid someone is going to steal my idea!\"**\n\nMy answer: **\"Let's certainly hope so.\"**\n\nObviously, I don't wish someone harm - far from it.  It's a mis-placed fear that stems largely from inexperience and a bit of mythology.\n\nHere's why -\n\n**1. Any idea that can be fully replicated simply by hearing about it has no \"competitive moat\"**.  The idea itself shouldn't be the unique value, it should be our ability to sustain the competition around the product (and company) as a whole.  If we can't articulate how we'll protect the product in the market, we're screwed.\n\n**2. The idea alone is 1% of the outcome, probably less.**  The idea is just what gets us started, it has little to no bearing on the final outcome.  That's where execution comes in.  I watch tons of companies with the same idea have geometrically different outcomes because the idea itself has so little weight.\n\n**3. Ideas that no one copies suck!**  The best ideas are the ones that everyone wants to copy because it's such a good idea!  The ones that no one copies are the ones that don't represent a good product (hence why I hope you get copied - it's the ultimate validation!\n\n**4. \"But Patents! NDAs! I can legally prevent people from stealing my idea!\"**  Good luck with that.  While those systems technically exist, your $$ ability to enforce them is likely zero.  While those protections can create a legal force field (maybe), it implies that your competition has no other way to create a version of your idea.\n\n... so what's the answer?  Treat your idea as something you want EVERYONE to know about, the more the better, and focus that nervous and protective energy on building a COMPANY that is better than anyone at producing and selling that product.  That's where your concerns should be.\n\n",

So let's talk about something else this month. I\u2019ll try to write some questions people ask this month and list it here so it doesn\u2019t get kept asked in the DM.\u00a0\n\n**Are you gonna take legal action against the shop?**\n\nNo, that would serve no purpose. you don\u2019t sue to win, you sue to get money. Nothing good can come out of this situation. As Koreans say, \u201c you avoid shit b/c it's dirty, not because it's dangerous.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Is there a specific reason why he\u2019s not willing to help?**\n\nBoba boss\u2019 main speciality is to grow and sell it. So let's say you can sell the company for 3x the sales. If all of his shops sell $100 a year. He can get $300 per store. But my shop only performs $50 a year, then he can only get $150 instead of $300. So he no longer wants anything to do with us. (Not paying franchise fee or the royalty didn\u2019t really help the cause either.)\n\n**What are you going to do now?**\u00a0\n\nAs always, I will do my best till the very end. My parents were furious at how this turned out but as for me, I'm going to keep at it. I do have some of their stocks for 2-3 months, so I\u2019ll just use those and later change to a new design.\u00a0\n\n**Jojo. I like your stories, any interest in taking it further and making youtube or etc.**\n\nNo. The last thing the world needs is a half baked newsletter, e-book, courses, youtuber, tiktoker. And I can only speak for myself but, remaining anonymous is one of the best things in this world. Considering how this boba shop turned around\u2026i guess it was the right move.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Focus. A singular point**\n\nI still haven\u2019t figured out how to expand or find a good way to summarize things I learned. fThe Format of reddit makes it so easy to troll since I can\u2019t write 100 pages to give examples, evidence, etc. So instead of the shotgun approach, I\u2019ll try to make it more singular.\n\nThis month, I'll talk about what I get asked most about cafe shops. How do you buy one?\u00a0  \n\n\n\u2014---------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Whose advice is better? The doctor or the trainer?**\n\nIf I am getting surgery, I want the best doctor possible. If I was trying to lose weight, would I listen to the doctor or the trainer? I listen to the trainer even if his knowledge isn\u2019t 100% scientific. Because I firmly believe the paper gap theory and those who have crossed the line know better even if it doesn\u2019t make logical sense. The world doesn\u2019t move through logic, but through emotions.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll discuss how to buy a turn key cafe (buying from someone else) rather than building from scratch. Because my experience is on turnkey cafe, not an empty key. My ideas have weight in the things I experience. I don\u2019t know how much it is to set up a table,\u00a0 lighting cost, or building it from scratch. I only talk about what I know .mSo here it goes.\u00a0\n\n**How much should I pay for a cafe?**\n\ngoogle \u201ccafe shop for sale\u201d or go visit bizbullsell, loopnet, crexi etc\u2026it will be listed like this\n\nAsking Price: $280,000  \nGross Revenue:\u00a0 $250,000\n\n**How would you build a basketball team?**\u00a0\n\nWhy does it only list two factors? How do you calculate the margin? Expense? Cash flow? Profit? Ok. Since not everybody is versed in purchasing. I\u2019ll describe it in a way that makes sense to everyone.\u00a0\n\nLet's say you are building a local basketball team. You don\u2019t have money to borrow a gym to test out everyone\u2019s skill or the time to go through everyone and set up a phone interview, or visit their local gym to see them play. So what would be the fastest way to build a team? I would ask for height, weight, highest level you played. This isn\u2019t the most optimal, but it would make sense right?\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not saying if you didn\u2019t play college, you are, or can be better than a college player, but if you have to bet based on what you know, it would be safer to bet on the college player right? \n\nIt's the same principle. What matter is the asking price for obvious reason. And gross revenue. Which is pretty much \u201chow much does the shop make\u201d\n\n**The numbers do not lie.** \n\nYou can get into small details about how many employees, the operating hours, location, etc.. but the 1st number needs to make sense. If you are unwilling to pay more than $200,000.00 for a shop, you need to walk away. If you start fidgeting the number to change the reality of the situation, the risk gets too much. Its like when people say \u201cI\u2019ve failed every test so far, but if I can get 96 on the finals, I can still pass.\u201d WRONG. You need to drop that course right now.\u00a0 \n\nKeep that in mind. Its not about potentials only you can see. You are a rookie, you are not going to fulfill the potential. And chances are ..saving up to $200k means your whole life savings. You have one shot.\u00a0\n\n**The liquid sales are 30%**\n\nAny business that deals with \u201cliquids\u201d is 30% profit.\u00a0\n\nSo for example, Gross Revenue listed as $250,000.00. Divide that by 12 months. It's about $20,833.33. \n\nSo what's 30% of that? Its $6,250.00\n\nSo this shop is making $6,250.00 per month. Now when people talk about \u201cmargins\u201d, what's the \u201cprofit\u201d ? What is \u201cEBDITA\u201d are all secondary. A minor detail. Like asking a college player, how many points did you score, which college did you play. It matters, but given that they played up to college, they have stamp of approval and passed certain \u201ctests.\u201d of a successful player (cafe). So if $6,260 sounds solid, then its to move on to the next part.\u00a0\n\nIn the same sense, you don\u2019t need to ask what the profits are. This can be manipulated by working longer hours, cutting employees, etc\u2026You just ask how much sales you do per month, and roughly you can get a good idea how well the shop is.\u00a0If net profit is $6,250.00 Well is taht including owner's salary? what is the owner's salary? Minimum wage? or living wage? etc...so profit can be manipulated, but gross revenue can't.Thats why franchise take 5% of gross revenue, not net profit. \n\n**The Super numbers.**\u00a0\n\nPreviously, I mentioned you need to make your original investment back in 3 years. So let's calculate that. This shop makes $6,250.00 per month.\u00a0\n\n$6,250.00 x 36 months = $225,000.00\n\n**Now the details**\n\nNow this shop was listed for $280,000 instead of $225,000.00 Why would they list it higher than the value of what is appropriate? Now then the third detail kicks in besides asking price and purchase price. They would ask for more b/c\u2026.the $6,250.00 is better at face value.\n\nIf they ask for more than the textbook price, it's b/c making that $6,250 is easier than the normal method. So on the website, newspaper, broker\u00a0 it will say something like....\n\n\u2013 closed on sunday\n\n\\- fully remote, manager operated\n\n\\- prime location\n\nUsually something that will say \u201cyou are paying more b/c it has X\u201d . Now if it was selling for a lot less like $225,000. Then it means $6,250.00 is harder to make.\u00a0It will say something like this...\n\n\\- profit possible if managed by husband/wife duo\n\n\\- lease is finished less than 2 years\n\n\\- no employees on weekends.\u00a0\n\nYou are paying less b/c you are working more.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**If the number make sense**\n\nNow if you are satisfied with the purchasing price and the gross revenue, now its time to do your due diligence. That $6,250. How is it broken down? How many people work? Who\u2019s working which hours? Do I need to work weekends? How old are the equipment? When is the lease up? Etc\u2026and always remember, they are selling b/c they want out. You have more leverage.\u00a0\n\nMinus the gross revenue\u2026.I would say rent would be next in the line. Its the most reliable indicator of the value of the location. And Location is like height in basketball. By far, the most important (i\u2019ll write this more later).\u00a0\n\n**The truth has no temperature**\n\nThe beauty in starting something is knowing that you can always make something better, but you have to understand what you are working with in the first place. You can\u2019t have 5\u20195 parents and expect to succeed playing basketball. You can have passion for the sports, make money becoming trick shot player, youtube ,commentator,\u00a0 etc, but not as a basketball player per say in the traditional sense.\u00a0\n\nIt's irrelevant whether you like coffee, or whether you are good at making coffee. Running a cafe business is not the same as loving coffee. A concept that eludes many many good people who love coffee that want to start the business.\u00a0\n\n**Where I went wrong**\n\n1st, I didn\u2019t ask the CPA about the cafe. That was the 1st problem. I bought it based on a trusted friend and his source.\u00a0\n\n2nd was getting the \u201creport\u201d card (Profit and Loss sheet) from the owner, not the CPA. The owner can make something up but CPA has no obligation to lie for the client. Since it will be CPA\u2019s ass on the line if caught up in a legal trouble.\u00a0\n\n3rd. I was in way too hurried to buy so I started fidgeting with the number (bro\\~ I don\u2019t have to pay franchise fee/royalty, this is a killer deal!). This shop was $50,000 at best. I paid double. And the profit is based on owner operated/managed. So it's even worse. I was making $2000-$3000 per month working 40 hours. Technically 80 since my wife worked as well.\u00a0\n\n4th. I got into a field I have no idea about. Which is fine since I accepted that the worst case scenario is 2-3 years of experience, but I think I overestimated what the cost that wasn\u2019t associated with the shop was. Stress from work, working weekends/nights costing me and my wife\u2019s date nights, managing negative cash flow shops.\u00a0\n\nNaivete knows no bounds.\u00a0\n\n**No shame in not knowing something. Be willing to learn**\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t know this before purchasing b/c I was a moron.I learned this through my CPA after the fact. An owner has to juggle a lot of things and my IQ is 10 points. I have to learn about coffee, people management, marketing, sales, etc\u2026\u00a0\n\nCPA number IQ 100000 pts since this is all they do.\u00a0 A good CPA will walk you through the number and see if it's worth it or not. A shitty CPA will just do the numbers, taxes, etc and leave you to be. Because CPA might know this is a bad shop, but he won't\u2019 get paid if you don't\u2019 buy the shop. So he\u2019ll just do his usual filing for tax, getting you a corporation set up, making you a P/L report.\u00a0\n\nA great CPA will break it down for you. The cost is too expensive. Try to negotiate the rent lower next time. This utility company is better, his other client buys from this boba wholesale, etc\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t know and just picked a decent CPA on my own and once we found out this shop hit the shit, I switched to my parents CPA who\u2019s been with us forever. He came to my wedding, bought me real expensive gifts that most CPAs wouldn\u2019t phantom buy for their client\u2019s son. Because his life was changed b/c of my parents he takes care of us in every way.\n\nHe was furious when he found out . He would never let me buy it if he was in the loop in the beginning. His actual words were \u201cJOJO WHAT THE FUCK WERE U THINKING?\u201d\n\nAnd once again I learned the advice my parents told me the most about business. .\u00a0 \u201cBusiness is about people, not about money.\u201d Having the right connection, right people are more important in the long run.\n\n**How do you know\u2026 that you know?**\n\nHow do you know you overpaid? How do you know your CPA Is good? How do you know if the coffee pricing is right?\n\nAs I mentioned previously, you don\u2019t guys. You learn through trial and error. Best way would be to get as close to the actual ownership as possible and the repercussion of mistakes will be left to the owner and not you. And you can take all these lessons that I made, and I can hope you\u2019ll make less.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m set for life in a financial sense\u2026.. and in all transparency, if I close the shop and just loses $4000 per month on rent and etc for the rest of the lease\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t even tickle my bank account. \n\nBut\u2026.\n\nI work hard, I can always look at the mirror and say \u201cI've given all my best despite it all.\u201d Although it doesn\u2019t hurt in a financial sense, it does hurt me personally. I feel like a fraud. Using mommy\u2019s money to start a cafe, a rich kid who couldn\u2019t cut it through, causing stress to my wife b/c my foolish dream, someone who is a imposter and business person in only in name, but that's something I been trying to overcome and hopefully help some of you guys understand.....\n\nthat is... it's terrifyingly hard to run a business. I have 5 employees and thats already stressful, i don't\u2019 know how my parents are managing 100+ people.  it will be a wild ride of emotional rollercoaster of stress, sadness, happiness, doubts, anger, fear, etc...\n\nI hope through my stories and mistakes, you guys can learn by proxy and help you on your journey to become a business person.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSee you guys next month!\n\n",

The Pandemic was extra bad (Canada completely shutdown), but money was good so I suffered it. Then 2023 and first half of 2024 was rough, economy was bad, things were extra slow. I felt really stuck.\n\nI started sharing my thoughts and business progress on Reddit and then X mid last year, that helped a lot. Eventually I started a discord server for dev agency owners, but keeping it active is super hard so I gave up on it and it's dead now.\n\nAfter that I decided to look for other communities to join, and I found a few that was pretty decent. One of them were more writing and self-help focused - for $30/month, that was fine but I left after a few month since it wasn't my jam.\n\nI briefly joined a few paid skool communities ($20-$100/m, nothing stuck), found a bunch of slack/discord community, one stood out: Rands leadership slack, it's super active and free. Still part of it and it's great.\n\nAround august I got connected with a founder on X who recently excited their startup. We had similar goals so he invited me to join the peer community he started. This one costed $250/m, a lot more organized with weekly speakers, monthly book club, monthly peer group sessions and in-person meetups. I went to one in NYC in September to the US open.\n\nOverall, pretty happy with the result, my personal goal was to just meet like minded people, and obviously see if there are business opportunities without being overly promotional.\n\nOverall rating, 7.8/10. Love the people, a lot based in Texas/North Carolina area, wish there were more in the Toronto area.",

            "description": "*Disclaimer: I do not sell anything or seek validation.*  \n*My opinions come from 20y+ in executive roles, working with 1k+ ppl companies, expertise in an investment fund, and firsthand experience raising multiple startups. My views are not from popular books or influencers and may seem controversial.*  \n*If your experience differs, I\u2019d be happy to hear it.*\n\nRecently, I received a thoughtful DM from a motivated student preparing for university. He has a strong drive for self-development and is actively building skills while deepening his understanding of various subjects. Instead of keeping this conversation private, I got his approval to share his insightful questions here so others may benefit as well:\n\n# Q&A Session\n\n**Q1:** Since I\u2019m still in high school and preparing for university, what\u2019s the best way to start building an entrepreneurial mindset early?\n\n**A1:** Learn yourself. Trust your instincts, use your strengths, and manage weaknesses. Work with your nature, not against it. Skills can be learned, but your potential is mostly set.  \nEngage with local and international startup communities, and participate in hackathons. No matter the niche, hands-on tech business experience will be valuable.\n\n**Q2:** Many people say you should start a business young, but others say you should first gain experience. In your view, what\u2019s the smarter approach?\n\n**A2:** Both approaches are valid. Experience provides a template, but a fresh perspective allows you to spot opportunities that experienced individuals might overlook. However, experience is essential for turning an idea into a sustainable business. Focus on identifying and validating ideas first, then bring in experienced people to help scale them.\n\n**Q3:** I often ask big \u2018why\u2019 questions, and I struggle with balancing ambition with uncertainty. How do you personally deal with uncertainty in decision-making?\n\n**A3:** Master project management\u2014life itself is a project, and this framework helps manage uncertainty and risk. It's not just theory; it's a skill.  \nEffective decision-making relies on data, not opinions. It\u2019s a craft that overlaps with project management but also requires independent refinement.  \n  \n**Q4:** People say businesses grow slowly, but I also hear about rapid success stories. What\u2019s the reality? And as someone who wants to enter entrepreneurship, what should I focus on right now to choose the right space\u2014should I explore widely, read more, or double down on what I\u2019m already good at?\n\n**A4:** Both approaches depend on the business model and market. Time is an investor\u2019s resource and should yield ROI. Finding a fast-growing model is a mix of luck and creativity. Success is always a blend of luck and effort, though ego often makes people overestimate their own skills and underestimate the role of timing and environment.\n\n**Q5:** You\u2019ve worked in different industries and markets. How do you decide when to pivot or stick to a path?\n\n**A5:** Follow your passion, but align it with your priorities. When my vision shifted and I was ready for the next level, I burned bridges behind me, using the fear of having no safety net to push forward. It wasn\u2019t easy, often struggling, but ultimately rewarding.\u00a0\n\n**Q6:** Over the years, how has your daily routine and discipline evolved? How do you structure your work and long hours while still progressing consistently?\n\n**A6:** Discipline and time management are essential at lower levels, but at higher levels, willpower, motivation, and a singular focus drive progress. The higher you rise, the more learning replaces working. I dedicate over 50h weekly to learning topics that interest me at the moment.\n\n**Q7:** What skills should I focus on right now to prepare for the future? Along with my studies, what else should I be doing to make sure I\u2019m building the right foundation? Are there specific projects or habits that would be most useful at this stage?\n\n**A7:** Focus on Project Management, Financial Literacy, Startup Fundamentals, Mind Mapping, Basic Psychology, Mental Resilience, Leadership, and Marketing. These skills create a solid foundation for adaptability in any field.",

New founders won\u2019t listen to me, but don\u2019t start with a product business.\n2. There is an ocean of skill-acquisition between you and what you want. Your corporate job doesn\u2019t train you to take people\u2019s money. The biggest ones are opportunity selection, lead generation, sales, and delegation. Each beasts unto themselves.\n3. You will suck for a long time because you\u2019re instantly a beginner at everything you\u2019re doing. Look at it like a flight of stairs. One day you\u2019ll wake up and be like \u201cwow I\u2019m kinda good at this\u201d. Patience and cash-generation help.\n4. 100% of things are highly competitive. Accept it and don\u2019t let the mere existence of competition discourage you.\n5. No one will take you seriously at first. This includes friends, family, customers, and vendors.\n6. Free work is a requirement to get going. Swallow your ego and build social proof.\n7. Most people can\u2019t help. Move from warm to cold outbound quickly.\n8. Be prepared to pay for help. It\u2019s silly not to. Would you try to become a great tennis player without a coach?\n9. 100% of business ideas have a reason to not do them. Make a judgement call, validate quickly, and be prepared to move to the next thing.\n10. Learning is a foregone conclusion and should not drive your decision-making. \u201caT LeAsT We\u2019LL LeArN sOmEtHiNg\u201d. No. You\u2019re going to learn regardless. Will the business make money?\n\nAnd finally, entrepreneurship is a bad choice if you want to optimize for being happy all the time.\n\nAnyone disagree?",

            "description": "hey guys, needed some help. \n\nThe context: \n1. Both my parents are successful entrepreneurs. During my whole life, I\u2019ve been involved into their business\u2019 fights that happened for many reasons. \nThey\u2019ve always worked with together while being a couple. My dad is bipolar and totally mentally disturbed and gave us the gift of fighting with everyone of our family, making us alone during our whole lives (I understand that there\u2019s a bunch of envy and bad feelings involved in the family as well, but it\u2019s hard to see everyone with uncles and aunts while I don\u2019t have). We have a very comfortable life in terms of money and this was always a thing in my life because i\u2019ve always felt guilty for feeling bad because i have parents that love me and a bunch of money to spend. \n\n2. During the past 10 years, i\u2019ve been struggling to find which career path I wanted. My dad runs a successful industry with very strong brand in his field here in our country and my mom is a fantastic administrator, she can make a failing business go back to being profitable, running 4 businesses at the same time. I started 3 undergrads and finished only the third one, business administration focused in marketing. I\u2019ve worked for the biggest cosmetics company here and was a very honored and known intern/analyst for my work and reputation there. \n\n3. I always wanted to live abroad. This was always that dream that is really a dream. Since I was in this last undergrad, I\u2019ve met some professors that were super famous here for their work and their reputation as researches, they\u2019ve lived in several countries and studied in different schools. I started to organize in my mind how I could do the same. Until I realized that I could go for an top20 MBA worldwide (but Europe being the top choice). I left the corporate, went to a supersoft startup (where I\u2019m now), did all the steps for the MBA that took me more than a year and got accepted into 3 programs. My choice was ESADE, Barcelona, for the quality of life, desire of learning a new language and school\u2019s reputation for #1 in entrepreneurship worldwide. \n\nFinally:\nI\u2019m 29yo and I don\u2019t know exactly what to do. In my dad\u2019s company, he is the one that creates the products. He\u2019s the responsible for everything. My mom\u2019s businesses are stores and gyms and ALL of them are in the very small town in the countryside that I HATE with people that I hate. They opened another business now in the pet industry with a very different (but not unique) product that I could start selling in Europe and worldwide in the next years. \nThis is one of my ideas. \nI have a sister that I don\u2019t have much contact with and I don\u2019t know what she wants to do with all of those companies and money. I feel very confused with everything. \nMy life\u2019s dream was to live traveling for work. A week in Spain, another in the US, another in Brazil\u2026\nand I don\u2019t know what I should do with all of this. \nShould we sell the medium-size industry and live our lives? Should I focus on this company? Or open this brand in Europe and start my own business? Or should I do both? \nWhen am I supposed to get dinner between all of this? \n\nI\u2019ve reached psychiatrists, psychologists, professors, entrepreneurs, corporate managers\u2026 everyone that I could but still stuck here. \n\nDo have any recommendations of who/which specialists I should talk to? Or something that you would like to say? ",

And today, I\u2019ve spent the whole day thinking about doing it, delaying it once again. I still have so many thoughts spinning in my head telling me that design isn\u2019t perfect, I have no idea how to launch on ProductHunt, I don\u2019t know how to write an email to the users already on the waitlist, and all that crap.\n\nHonestly? I\u2019m not ready, I don\u2019t know anything, absolutely nothing, but you know what? **Fuck it**, Sunday I\u2019m launching my app. Let the sky fall if it has to. It won\u2019t be perfect, it won\u2019t be the prettiest, it won\u2019t have a launch that\u2019ll attract thousands of users, but fuck it, it\u2019s an idea I\u2019ve put time and sweat into, and once and for all, I want to make it public.

I\u2019ll also mention how much I charge as well.\n\n- Meditation (frequency music, guided meditation) \n- Spirituality Themed Weekly podcast \n- Home screen Widget that displays Stoic quotes \n- To - Do list, simple UI \n- Alarm clock with frequency based sounds that wakes you up with a morning affirmation \n- Vision board creator that allows you to upload images and create vision boards \n- Affirmation and Breathing exercise with many categories, general daily affirmations, chakra specific categories, affirmations based on spiritual leaders teachings \n- Micro journaling feature that allows you to journal on the go \n- Entire Bhagavad Gita with verse interpretations and note taking tool \n- Yoga feature that allows you to create your own yoga workout or choose from pre set ones \n- Spirituality AI thats trained on spiritual and vedic teachings, an expert on all things spirituality\n\nHow much would you pay for an app that has all this? $5/mo? $10/mo? I\u2019m charging only $1.99 per month to cover database and hosting costs. \n\nNow I\u2019m taking a few approaches to advertising, I\u2019ll be honest right now i have less than 100 users on the app. \n\nI tried creating blogs on Medium, posting Tiktok videos, and graphics on instagram. Now I\u2019m thinking of paying some influencers to advertise the app for me. In this day and age of AI i don\u2019t know if the influencer\u2019s statistics are evel real or bots. \n\nI can develope and virtually create any product, I\u2019m not a merketter, so please.

Not like we needed them anyway.\n\nBut the most persistent ones push forward, practically rubbing their hands in excitement as they finally spot the buns\u2014only to be greeted by\u2026\n\nJerry the Cockroach.\n\nJerry has been here for the same 20 years and doesn\u2019t bother anyone. Every old-time customer knows him well. They give him a respectful nod in the morning before grabbing their beloved buns and enjoying them with coffee as bitter as an immigrant\u2019s life.\n\nBut these newcomers, these weaklings, fail to appreciate the nuances of local culture. They throw in the towel and shuffle toward the exit under Debbie\u2019s disapproving gaze.\n\nHowever, to be fair, not all are so weak. Some people possess a special kind of resilience. They fear no hardships, no challenges. They\u2019ll happily crush obstacles like Jerry and devour him along with their buns and coffee.\n\nYes, they are few, but the five of them, united in their pursuit of victory, proudly grab their buns and head to the checkout.\n\nNothing can stop these heroes!\n\nExcept\u2026\n\nA note on the register from Debbie: \u201cGone for 5 minutes. Be right back.\u201d\n\nAfter ten rounds of \u201c5 minutes,\u201d even the toughest warriors surrender and trudge toward the exit, defeated.\n\nExcept for one.\n\nNothing can break him.\nBecause the buns were ordered by his wife.\nAnd you know she\u2019s in that mood where coming home without them is simply not an option.\n\nSo he wins! YES! There he is, our victorious champion!\nMarching home with his five buns, having paid his hard-earned 30 bucks.\n\nAnd the only one truly upset in this whole story?\n\nThe store owner, Brian.\n\n\u201cDamn that Lisa, took her 200 bucks, spread the rumors, and what did I get? 30 bucks?! What a joke! May she fall off the face of the earth!\u201d",

The gym would target high-end weightlifters and offer no frills such as personal trainers, tanning beds, *etc.*  At the risk of sounding clich\u00e9, I intend for it to be \"the iPhone\" of gyms: no frills, but it will be excellent with what it does have.\n\nA rough estimate of the cash that I would need is $300 000.  I graduate with an MS in mathematics at the end of the year (meaning that my market research will be excellent\u2014I hope), and I intend to have the business plan done at the end of the year.\n\nWith this said, is an SBA loan with a guarantor a possibility?  My concern is that my education is not in business and I have not had a career job.  I have successfully done freelance work in software, and I do have leadership experience, but it is minimal and involves fast food (although our location is quite literally in the top 5% of all fast food stores in the US by most KPIs...).\n\nThank you for your input.",

            "description": "I\u2019m a 28 year old male. When I was 25 I moved to Dallas from a small midwest town. I grew up there and went to College there. After college, I had a job lined up at a Fortune 500 company working in tech. I was working there for 2.5 years and decided to leave for a startup. The role was remote, so I decided to move to Dallas. The reason I wanted to move was for personal growth and development.\u00a0\n\nI moved to Dallas in June of 2022. I was working fine and then in April of 2023 I was laid off.\u00a0 Fortunately, I was given a severance package and unemployment which I was grateful for. I decided to sign a lease and tried searching for work. So from April 2023 to October 2023 I was on the job hunt. I couldn\u2019t land anything, maybe I was picky.\u00a0\n\nI decided to start a business in January 2024 and also tried to still look for work.\u00a0 I was working on the business, but it was hard to grow because I was taking money out to pay my bills. I was also not budgeting. The business was going well the first 3 months and it started getting bad, but I decided to keep pushing and hopes of finding a job. I finally found a job in October of 2024 and was terminated in December of 2024, because I worked while on PTO\u2026 which is against HR policy.\u00a0\n\nWhen this happened and I realized the business also crashed, I went into panic mode, and anxiety and fear kicked in. I was barely sleeping and eating. I realized how much money I lost on the business and the time as well. I fell into a state of sadness and self-hatred.\n\nI realized how bad I was with money. I was careless. Even during the pandemic I basically gambled my money in stocks and other stupid investments. I thought this was a way to get my family out of poverty since I grew up poor.\n\nI also realized I didn\u2019t take my career seriously. When I was in Dallas I did a lot of partying and exploring, instead of keeping a balance and focusing on my career.\u00a0\n\nI told myself If I didn\u2019t make all these stupid decisions. I would be in a better place financially. I have a lot of resentment and regrets. If only I would\u2019ve thought this way. Instead of this way. Maybe I should\u2019ve reached out to parents and friends back home. But I decided\u00a0\n\nI now have about \\~3$5k saved and $16K in credit cards from starting the business. Not to mention the money I invested into the business.\n\n\u00a0I\u2019m living back at home with my parents. Seeing all my friends progress in life in their careers of relationships and seeing where am at really just puts me down. Maybe I would\u2019ve been better if I stayed and didn\u2019t take that job. Maybe if I thought further or thoroughly I would have made better choices.\u00a0 Maybe I should\u2019ve come back home when I was initially laid off instead of signing that lease.\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019m doomed and time is just slipping away. \u00a0",

Meaning either finding an agency or some freelancers to help with drafting out marketing strategy, social media creatives (photos/ videos). I will very involved in the ideation and analytics of course\n\n- What is the best strategy here after this step (either outsourcing it or not), is there timeline/ posting targets we should be aiming for IG/ FB/ TT and Youtube? Posting everyday for instance and getting to 10k in 3 months?\n\n- Should we focus on 1 platform only? \n\n- What kinds of content should we be posting? Since we are starting from scratch no one knows about it. We have 2 followers (1 is me). Seems like hashstags are not working? How can we make sure our content/ creatives are reaching the right audience?\n\n- I have heard about: working with micro influencers - asking them promote, engaging with similar accounts and commenting on their page, doing give aways\n\nAnything else? Again, would love to hear thoughts. I am spending hours doing creatives (just still photos) and don\u2019t even look good. After posting, we only get 1 like lol. With this kind of engagement, how can we get any sale once we launch?\n",

            "description": "Six months ago, I was a content strategist. Today, I'm a tech founder. Here's how that happened\u2026\n\nFor six years, my wife and I ran a boutique content strategy for SaaS companies, but we always dreamed of building our own product.\n\nI had a background in basic programming, but just for stuff like conversion rate optimization and A/B testing (basic JS and HTML), but I didn\u2019t just want to build an app for the sake of it. I wanted to solve a pain point I personally had.\n\nFor the past couple of years, I've noticed a big problem: clients are tightening their belts when it comes to content. Many founders believe AI can do the job, so they expect to pay less for content services. This shift has been a real challenge for us.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t blame most of them \u2013 90% of these companies do not need to pay thousands of $$$ to get started with content; they probably don\u2019t need the super deep research, SME interviews, months of competitor analysis, etc.\u00a0\n\nWhat these businesses needed was a way to automate most of the boring and technical stuff to get started with SEO as soon as possible.\n\nSo I asked myself, why not try to steer away from the services-side of entrepreneurship and start building that tool myself.\n\n**The \u201clearning how to code\u201d phase**\n\nMy coding background was pretty basic - mostly JavaScript and HTML for conversion rate optimization. Building a SaaS platform was a whole different challenge. I spent about a year learning advanced development patterns, mostly through online courses and a lot of practice. The learning process was interesting, to say the least, especially since I decided to go the serverless architecture route.\n\nAnd let me tell you, working with Cloudflare Workers was challenging. Their documentation felt like reading a mystery novel where half the pages were missing. Thankfully, I had friends at larger tech companies who reviewed my code, especially the backend security. Their input was invaluable and helped me a ton.\n\n**Here\u2019s what I learned along the way**\n\n\u2705Starting small really works. My first version was basic, but it worked well enough to continue developing it;\n\n\u2705Having experienced developers review your code is crucial;\n\n\u2705Sometimes you have to figure things out yourself when documentation falls short (or ask Claude);\n\n**\u2757Launching something good today beats launching something perfect next year\u2757**\n\nHappy to share more about my journey, technical challenges or transitioning from services to product.",

            "description": "Recently read an interesting and honest post about someone's failure so I thought I'd share mine. \n\nDuring the start of my PhD i was very interested in a side project that I really believed in. It was in a hot area around physical tokenisation. \n\nFor ego purposes I started marketing the idea on Instagram, mainly because I wanted to say I was the first person to properly prove the point. It became fairly clear noone was seeing it, cared about it or really understood it. But I still knew I was right.\n\nI saw a (technoglically poor) competitor with tonnes of funding (millions from billionaire investors) with major connections (guy was a big nepo dude). I put a message on their Instagram highlighting their obvious issues and said i knew how to solve them. \n\nTo my suprise they actually came back to me and I met up with them a couple of times to chat about technology etc. I was years ahead of them technologically, it was embarrassing how bad they were. Tbh it really affected me, I started to believe that most tech was just a cartle run by nepo morons and they could never match me (back then i was outrageously arrogant). I do now realise connections are probably the most valuable thing in the start up world, which I'm guessing why so many start up networks recieve so much money.\n\nAnyways, I never really forced the collaboration, I was distracted by my PhD i didnt focus on the business and thought I was above them. \n\nWe'd discussed other companies working on the same problem, they were all pretty bad, their solutions all sacrificed accuracy over price, the point was it needs to be 100% accurate and none of these were even close. I thought I had all the time in the world.\n\nFast forward 2 years, I finished my PhD and am like, ill work on my business now. Turns out, a competitor has now had its first funding round with JPMorgan and was since purchased by a massive company for an undisclosed amount (i know it was ~200mn, only 3 staff members). It's not as good as mine but the reality is, they seized the moment and are now all millionaires while I'm basically on the ends. The guy i was speaking to went bust, he's fine, was worth millions already and is out of the game, tbh he was never really in it.\n\nI think I have three major learnings from this. Firstly, you're the entrepreneur, sometimes you really shouldn't listen to people, I recieved probably more negative critiques and was rejected funding from multiple accelerators despite an inferior copy being sold for 200mn. I think i let that get to me which made me focus on the phd over the business, where as, in reality i should have focused on the business and not the phd.\n\nSecondly, I need to understand the start up ecosystem better, I was rejected multiple times despite a solid idea, clearly I was incapable of properly getting across the potential of the idea which is something I need to work on. I come from research, but selling is arguably more important, no sales, no business.\n\nFinally I think if you get a major headwind you really need to run with it. After meeting the first company, I really should have dropped what i was doing to integrate with them and push a sale with them. If opportunity arises, you really should seize it then and there. I was waiting to perfect things, I should have just got the MVP out there and figured it out after. I think the process has humbled me, I believed I was genuinely years smarter than everyone else and I could just stop and come back and still be technological lead, technically I still have an edge even today, but their MVP was good enough to basically dominate the market so it doesn't matter.\n\nI think all of these points seem obvious now and potentially are to you all as experienced entrepreneurs but we're tough learnings to myself. Im hoping to make a whole new set of mistakes with my next venture. ",

            "description": "You've probably seen the video from Rand Fishkin (SparkToro) about the zero-click marketing world.\n\nThere are 2 simple ideas:\n\n1. 1Platforms (search engines and social media) work hard to keep the user's attention on their platforms. For example, most social media penalize your posts if you include links.\n2. In many cases, users also don't want to leave a platform to get the answer.\n\nBusinesses can't change it. You can only adapt.\n\nRand says that it leads to a zero-click marketing world. Brands are fighting more and more for impressions, not website traffic.\n\nI agree with this statement. I observe it on my brand Sitechecker and other brands I work with as a consultant.\n\nI guess this is a big shift that will have long-term consequences:\n\n**1/ The accuracy of measuring ROI by one specific channel will drop significantly.**\n\n**2/ It means B2B marketers will make more mistakes. The cost of mistakes will rise too.**\n\n**3/ As a result more B2B brands will ask you, where you find them the first time, during onboarding.**\n\n**4/ Brands will spend more resources on designing content for each platform**\n\nIt is no longer enough to publish an interesting article and distribute a link to it through social networks.\n\n**5/ Email newsletters never died, but now they're getting a second wind.**\n\nPlatforms aren't just trying to keep people's attention. They're showing your content to all your followers less and less. That's also why I launched Hack the Algo newsletter on Substack a month ago.\n\n**5/ The influencer marketing boom in B2B is just beginning. The rise of LinkedIn can be both a cause and a consequence of this.**\n\nI see how Favikon ratings are becoming viral very quickly and how many people are already looking for these ratings on Google.\n\n**6/ CRO and copywriting will become even more important.**\n\nLess traffic on the website = each visitor is more expensive = you have to figure out how to convert him/her.\n\nAlso, only the right message to the right audience can force people to leave the platform and visit your website.\n\n**7/ SEO isn't dead.**\n\n* there is always new information people will look for that AI chats haven't learned yet;\n* for many SaaS websites, SEO helps to understand how to improve UX too (people still don't want duplicates, want live pages, visible images, easy tools, etc);\n* I believe we still need static pages that are easy to find, recognize who is behind them, link to them, and send friends. Posts on social media and excerpts from AI chats aren't good for it.\n\nWhat is the 9th?\n\n**P.S.** Also, correct me if you disagree with any statement.",

            "description": "I've been working as an iOS performance consultant for the past few years, and I wanted to share a recent success story that might help others facing similar challenges. This is a detailed breakdown of how I transformed a struggling app into a success story.\nThe Initial Situation\nA fintech startup approached me with a critical problem: their app was hemorrhaging users and sitting at a 2.1\u2605 rating on the App Store. The main complaints? \"Sluggish,\" \"freezes constantly,\" and \"takes forever to load.\" You know, the usual suspects.\nThe Investigation\nAfter diving into the code and running extensive profiling (Instruments is your best friend!), I discovered several common but devastating issues:\n\nImage processing was happening on the main thread (I know, I know...)\nMemory usage was 3x higher than necessary\nNetwork calls were blocking UI interactions\nNo caching strategy in place\nTableView cell recycling was essentially non-existent\n\nThe Fix\nHere's the step-by-step process we implemented:\n1. Thread Management\n\nMoved all heavy processing to background queues\nImplemented proper GCD practices\nSet up a robust async/await architecture for modern iOS versions\n\n2. Memory Optimization\n\nImplemented proper cell recycling for UITableViews/UICollectionViews\nSet up an intelligent caching system\nAdded automated memory cleanup triggers\nResult: Memory usage dropped by 68%\n\n3. Intelligent Loading\nThis was the game-changer. Instead of loading everything at once, we:\n\nImplemented predictive loading based on user behavior\nCreated a custom prefetching system\nSet up progressive image loading\nAdded skeleton views for loading states\n\n4. Monitoring\n\nIntegrated performance monitoring\nSet up crash reporting\nCreated custom analytics for performance metrics\n\nThe Results (after 3 weeks)\n\nApp Store rating increased from 2.1\u2605 to 4.6\u2605\nCrash rate decreased by 89%\nUser session length increased by 47%\nChurn rate decreased by 35%\nApp size reduced by 28%\nCold start time reduced by 56%\n\nKey Lessons Learned\n\nPerformance is about perception: Users don't care about milliseconds; they care about feeling fast\nProactive > Reactive: Catch issues before users notice them\nMonitor everything: You can't improve what you don't measure\nProgressive enhancement: Start with a solid base experience and enhance based on device capabilities\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\n\nDon't block the main thread, ever\nDon't load everything at startup\nDon't ignore memory warnings\nDon't skip caching\nDon't wait for user complaints to optimize\n\nTools I Used\n\nInstruments (especially Time Profiler and Allocations)\nFirebase Performance Monitoring\nCustom analytics dashboard\nMetricKit\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions or provide more specific details about any part of the process. Also, for those interested, I do occasionally take on new clients for performance optimization work.",

            "description": "I have been doing weekend side hustles for a while to make extra money, and also switch it to a full-time commitment once it takes off to a good paying gig. \n\nThe most interesting part for this is that some weekends it is just hard to find the motivation for grinding. Bc it literally takes a lot of time until something even becomes a small success. One important factor that keeps me working hard is that I love my side hustles because they bring impact not just money, for now I have two projects. : 1. I run a community (BeLoud) for university students to work with them to find a career in startups or start their small businesses. 2. I do YouTube content on entrepreneurship topic (The Builder\u2019s Mind). \n\nI love both, but still sometimes it takes extra motivation to make it work. \n\nSo eager to know if you have any side hustles for the weekend? What are they? And how do you find time and motivation to do that? \n\nCheers to all weekend doers \ud83d\ude0e",

I am also juggling another FT job. A few months ago I came up on an opportunity to recruit several employees for a former business partner that I couldn\u2019t miss. \n\nRecruiters out there, that job can really suck. And it\u2019s tough! I\u2019m not sure recruiters get enough credit for what they do. Kudos, for real. I\u2019m never planning on doing any recruiting in the future. Like EVER. Talk about soul draining. \n\nI worked my ass off for the last few months, and was afraid a 20 year business relationship between myself in the client went straight to shit. He ghosted me for almost a month immediately after I sent him my invoices. I\u2019d call, email, follow up with his employees, and even talk to his wife with no communication from him. It was weird and not like him. He\u2019s a stand up guy but I do know he always avoided paying his bills. \n\nThe payments came in the mail today! Today is bittersweet because of that, but here is what I learned.\n\nAlways get a signed contract! \nThis client is very very close to me, and despite having given countless other clients advice to protect themselves in all business transactions I didn\u2019t on this one. He tried to low ball me on my percentages (which were extremely low, like embarrassingly low), and claim that he helped things along. That wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nDon\u2019t let candidates know who your client is by any circumstances!\nI also stupidly agreed to have his email in the job postings. Well, I found out today he hired someone I did not screen yet, because I was waiting to hear feedback on the other candidates I referred to him. Dumb mistake on my part. For adding his email address AND not screening the candidate. Rookie mistake. \n\nPlan for the future in your contracts and agreements!\nIt gets worse\u2026 I sent him a contract, no string attached if he hired people on his own, but the bastard still hasn\u2019t signed it. I have written agreement to pay me what he has already, but I\u2019m certain I\u2019m getting stiffed on the 4 other candidates I recommended. \n\nToday is a bitter sweet day. I finally got paid on my past due invoices but I\u2019m kicking myself in the ass for not taking my own advice. Trust no one in business and don\u2019t put in the work until you get contracts signed.

            "description": "I've had this idea for a while\u2014it sounded appealing to me. I told GPT my concept, and it rephrased it a bit. The app might be a little cringe, but I didn\u2019t have a better idea, so I went with this. The MVP is almost finished, but I\u2019m not sure if anyone would actually use it. I\u2019m curious to hear opinions and if anyone has suggestions on how I could improve it. At first, I called it Milestones & Moments, but that felt too long, so now it\u2019s called Joylapse.\n\n\n\n\n\nApp Concept: Joylapse - \"Milestones & Moments\"\n\nOverview:\nThe app, Milestones & Moments, is designed to create a space where users can share their personal journeys, struggles, achievements, gifts they've received, and everything that shapes their life in an emotional or milestone-based way. It's a social platform built around vulnerability and positive reinforcement, without the pressure of curation or showy content. Users are connected through shared experiences, and the app creates a safe, supportive community for people to share life\u2019s little victories, big challenges, and meaningful moments with others who genuinely care.\n\n\n---\n\nCore Features:\n\nPersonal Experience Sharing:\n\nUsers can post personal updates around different categories: Achievements, Challenges, Gifts, Struggles, etc.\n\nTagging System: Each post can be tagged with one or more keywords (e.g., #gift, #overcomingfear, #goalcompleted) to make it easier for users to find similar stories.\n\n\nDaily/Weekly Prompts:\n\nStructured Sharing: Every day or week, users receive gentle prompts to help guide their reflections, like \"What\u2019s one small victory you've had today?\" or \"Share a gift you got that meant something to you.\"\n\nHelps build healthy sharing habits and can spark meaningful posts.\n\n\nEmotion & Reaction-Based Interaction:\n\nInstead of \u201clikes,\u201d the app uses positive reactions like \u201cCheering you on\u201d or \u201cI understand\u201d to keep the atmosphere supportive and non-judgmental.\n\nUsers can comment, but the focus is on support and empathy, not on maximizing attention or likes.\n\n\nSmart Matches and Connection:\n\nAI-powered matching: The app connects users who have gone through similar experiences or people who are currently facing similar struggles, so they can support each other.\n\nBuilds real community through shared emotional connections and experiences.\n\n\nMilestone Tracking:\n\nUsers can track ongoing personal goals or challenges (e.g., fitness, mental health, education).\n\nDisplays a personal milestone timeline so users can see their journey over time and how they've grown.\n\n\nPrivacy Control:\n\nPrivacy options will allow posts to be shared with specific friends or with the whole community. Users will also be able to post anonymously if they prefer to keep certain struggles or achievements private.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nUI/UX Design:\n\nSimple, Clean Layout:\n\nFocus on Minimalism: The design will be clean, with soft color tones and intuitive navigation to promote an inviting atmosphere.\n\nA scrollable feed showcasing posts from others (with categories) and easy access to upload your own posts.\n\n\nPersonal Profile Pages:\n\nA profile will include your own milestones and experiences\u2014focusing more on milestones and categories of experiences (rather than general personal info).\n\nProgress Bars: Users can track their growth in specific areas, encouraging continual self-reflection.\n\n\nEmotional Engagement:\n\nReactions and supportive comments encourage deeper connections.\n\nEach post will have an \"emotion icon\" users can press to express empathy (e.g., heart, thumbs-up, encouragement).\n\n\nUser Journey Mapping:\n\nWhen users start sharing and reflecting on their milestones, they will receive regular reminders and updates about their journey, helping them remain engaged and reinforcing a habit of self-reflection and progress.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nHow To Attract and Scale Users:\n\nEmotional Appeal:\n\nMarket the app as a space to emotionally connect and find community. People are craving meaningful connections in the age of superficial social media.\n\nUse authentic testimonials (maybe early adopters sharing their personal milestones), showing the power of vulnerable and supportive community interactions.\n\n\nShareable Content:\n\nEncourage users to share their milestones and progress stories on other platforms, which can bring awareness and attention from people outside the app.\n\n\nEngagement Gamification:\n\nIncorporating a light gamification system, like badges for consistent posting, \u201cAchievements unlocked\u201d for community support, etc., will make engagement rewarding.\n\n\nLocal Communities / Global Reach:\n\nInitially, focus on building smaller local or niche communities (e.g., for personal struggles like mental health or fitness challenges), but expand globally as the platform scales.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nHow it Stands Out:\n\nUnlike traditional social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, Milestones & Moments provides an intimate space for personal growth and reflection, emphasizing connection through shared experiences.\n\nThe focus is not on gaining followers or likes but on building a community based on authentic emotions, struggles, and support.\n\nThere's no pressure to curate a \"perfect life.\" People come here to support each other, celebrate small wins, and grow together through shared moments\u2014allowing for genuine social connections rather than just follower counts.\n\n\n\n---\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nMilestones & Moments seeks to carve out a new kind of social platform centered around shared emotional experiences and personal growth. The AI-powered community matching, user-friendly design, and dedicated focus on meaningful content set this app apart from the fast-paced, curated environments we currently have. It offers a refreshing, supportive space where people can be real, share the ups and downs of life, and connect with others who genuinely understand and care.\n\n",

The biggest lesson?\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Speed doesn\u2019t mean sloppy\u2014it means focus.\n\nMost people delay launching because they\u2019re adding \u201cjust one more feature.\u201d But in reality, launching fast forces you to cut the fluff and validate real demand.

Just wireframes, quick iterations, and real user feedback to make sure it was intuitive.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Code What Matters \u2013 Login, core functionality, App Store optimization\u2014no fancy extra features, just what\u2019s needed to launch.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Launch & Learn \u2013 We submitted to the App Store on Day 7, gathered early user feedback, and iterated.

            "description": "Last weekend, I wanted to see if we are actually as fast as everyone says. \n\nOur SaaS is almost a year old now, and folks keep telling us, \"You're shipping features at lightning speed!\" \n\nBut I needed real data to back that up. So, I took our entire changelog and the entire changelog of a well-known competitor whom I admire (they\u2019ve been around for 4\u20135 years). Luckily they use the same changelog software as ours so it was easy to get the same format. Then I fed that to ChatGPT o1 model, gave it some prompts, and waited for magic to happen:\n\n1. First, ChatGPT helped me categorize all the features (because we use different wording) into a neat side-by-side timeline.\n\n2. Second, it calculated exactly how many months after launch each of us shipped each feature. That alone was super insightful!\n\n3. Then I said, \u201cLet\u2019s do a scoreboard: who shipped each feature first, and by how many months?\u201d\n\nI was pumped about the results (spoiler: we beat them on quite a few by a wide margin), but I wanted more depth. So o1 suggested three scoring methods: \n\n1. Time based: Give a weighted score for each based on how soon the feature has been shipped. \n\n2. Feature complexity based: Give score for features based on complexity (small, medium, high) and then calculate score. Complexity is pretty subjective but works better than simple time based approach. \n\n3. Hybrid method: Calculate the score based on how fast one ship multiplied by the complexity weightage. Loved that o1 suggested this method. \n\nI went with the hybrid approach (feature complexity \u00d7 time difference). The final numbers? We scored 316, they got 48. So we are 6.5x faster than our competitor whom we admire. \n\nThat was a feel-good moment but what do I do with this data? \n\nLast thing a human would need is an appreciation by an AI model. I wanted to get some actionable insights. \n\nSo, next I asked it to look at our own Feature Requests board, compare it against the gaps in the competitor\u2019s changelog, and - boom - it came back with a prioritised list of about 5 features we absolutely should build next for maximum ROI. \n\nNow, I have a crystal clear roadmap for the next few months. This research could have been an hours of work. Thanks to ChatGPT I was able to wrap it in less than 15 minutes with couple of prompts.\n\n",

            "description": "For the last 6 months I've been building Guided Peaks, a two sided marketplace. Sharing this to help anyone who also picked one of the harder businesses to start: a two sided market place.\n\nIdeally you make a product/service which a group needs. Then you just listen to them, improve/adapt your thing, share back to them, and keep repeating that cycle towards product market fit. Then add marketing/advertising to get growth (ok it's not that simple, but you get the point).\n\nSadly the problem with a two sided market place is the chicken and egg situation. For instance with Guided Peaks I connect climbers with guides for mountains they want to climb. But climbers won't use the site if there are no guides, and guides won't use the site if there are no climbers there. So getting started and any traction is extra hard - even if you can design/invisage a great useful service.\n\nThis means having to effectively build two products in parallel, with a poor feedback cycle (as you can't tell if it's your offering or lack of opposing group that is the issue).\n\nMy strategy for solving this was to pick one group to focus on, the one with the greater need. In my case I decided that was Guides. Since they are all competing for the same business and theremore more motivated to try new things to reach their audience.\n\nFor example I focussed on building a better guide dashboard for them. I emailed them all to understand what other platforms were missing, and then implemented every feature they seemed to need.\n\nThis lead me to getting hundreds of guides signing up, as although there weren't loads of climbers, they at least could put their best foot forward (as they wanted).\n\nThen finally with lots of guides, slowly but surely climbers started signing up. That part was more like auto pilot - they wanted to access the community of guides (see prices, reviews, etc). From here I hope there is a nice feedback loop between the two groups enlarging and feeding off each other.\n\nI'm interested if anyone else has tried to build a two sided marketplace and how they solved this problem.\n\nFor me I will next time just make a normal product/service business with only one user group.",

When I'm juggling so many hats\u2014product development, marketing, customer support\u2014it\u2019s easy to feel like there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day. Recently, I\u2019ve been reflecting on how I allocate my time and trying to improve.\n\nOne of my big realizations is that not all tasks are created equal when it comes to Typogram. Some things, like planning the bigger picture or talking to users, have a long-term impact, while others, like tweaking small details, feel productive in the moment but don\u2019t really move the needle. I\u2019m learning to prioritize tasks that align with my goals and outsource or delay the non-critical ones. It's been a learning curve because as a founder there are just so many tasks to do.\n\nI\u2019ve also started to embrace imperfect progress. As a perfectionist, it\u2019s hard to let go of the idea that everything needs to be flawless. But I\u2019ve found that getting something done, even if it\u2019s not perfect, is often better than spending endless hours chasing perfection.\n\nTime management is definitely still a work in progress for me. I\u2019d love to hear how you manage your time effectively.",

            "description": "I quit my last corporate job at the end of 2022\u2026 a decision followed by an overwhelming feeling of \u201cwhat have I done?\u201d\n\nSince then I started 2 businesses.\n\nOne payments biz got to 250K in GMV in 6 months, then died. The other is a services business currently running at a modest $7K / month, 3 months in.\n\nI recently re-read my 2 year old thinking on why I took the leap.\n\nMy thinking has evolved since then.\n\nThings definitely do not go how you think you\u2019re gonna go.\n\nI know some of your reading this are thinking about taking the leap. I\u2019m lookin at you.\n\nHere are 11 uncomfortable realities about entrepreneurship I learned after the fact:\n\n1. Unscalable services are the fastest way to generate cash. New founders won\u2019t listen to me, but don\u2019t start with a product business.\n2. There is an ocean of skill-acquisition between you and what you want. Your corporate job doesn\u2019t train you to take people\u2019s money. The biggest ones are opportunity selection, lead generation, sales, and delegation. Each beasts unto themselves.\n3. You will suck for a long time because you\u2019re instantly a beginner at everything you\u2019re doing. Look at it like a flight of stairs. One day you\u2019ll wake up and be like \u201cwow I\u2019m kinda good at this\u201d. Patience and cash-generation help.\n4. 100% of things are highly competitive. Accept it and don\u2019t let the mere existence of competition discourage you.\n5. No one will take you seriously at first. This includes friends, family, customers, and vendors.\n6. Free work is a requirement to get going. Swallow your ego and build social proof.\n7. Most people can\u2019t help. Move from warm to cold outbound quickly.\n8. Be prepared to pay for help. It\u2019s silly not to. Would you try to become a great tennis player without a coach?\n9. 100% of business ideas have a reason to not do them. Make a judgement call, validate quickly, and be prepared to move to the next thing.\n10. Learning is a foregone conclusion and should not drive your decision-making. \u201caT LeAsT We\u2019LL LeArN sOmEtHiNg\u201d. No. You\u2019re going to learn regardless. Will the business make money?\n\nAnd finally, entrepreneurship is a bad choice if you want to optimize for being happy all the time.\n\nAnyone disagree?",

A tax write-off is any business related expense that reduces your taxable income, ultimately lowering how much you owe in taxes. Claiming all eligible deductions can significantly impact your bottom line.\n\nCommon Write-Offs You Might Be Missing:\n\n* Auto Expenses - Business-related mileage, fuel, maintenance, and even insurance could be deductible.\n* Startup Costs - Expenses from launching your business, like registration fees, equipment, or legal services\u2014can qualify.\n* Professional Services - Costs for legal advice, accounting, consulting, and even LLC formation services can be deducted.\n* Advertising - Marketing expenses such as website hosting, social media ads, flyers, and branded merchandise are often eligible.\n* Home Office - If you work from home, a portion of your rent, utilities, and internet expenses might be deductible.\n\nEvery deduction reduces your taxable income, saving you money and allowing more funds to reinvest in your business. A lot of small business owners leave money on the table by not claiming all their eligible write-off. Make sure to ask your account what deductions you might be eligible for this tax season. ",

I\u2019d love to get some advice, recommendations, or feedback on my idea!\n\nThe business I have in mind is a doggy daycare called \u2018Fur-ever Friends,\u2019 based in Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to offer:\n\n- Full-day and part-day daycare options from 6:30 AM to 6 PM.\n- Pick-up and drop-off services in a doggy bus for nearby neighborhoods.\n- Live webcam access so owners can check in on their pets.\n- We will feature lots of outdoor time, with a playground equipped with fun slides, bridges, and large obstacles for play. The ground will be covered in sand for a natural feel, and during summer, a small pool with be available for the dogs to cool off \n- Would also consider to offer bathing services on site during summer time when their furs can get messy  \n\nPrimary Target Audience:\n\nBusy pet owners: Individuals with demanding schedules (e.g., professionals, students, shift workers) who need reliable daytime care for their dogs.\n\nElderly pet owners: Seniors who may need help caring for their dogs during the day.\n\n\nOur goal is to provide a safe, fun, and loving space for dogs while making life easier for their owners. We understand how busy work and school can get, and we want to offer reliable, high-quality care with added convenience. As we grow, we plan to partner with local groomers and pet stores to offer more services and exclusive discounts.\n\n\nPricing:\n\nFull Day: $35\n30 Full-Day Package: $31 per day\nHalf Day: $30\n30 Half-Day Package: $26 per day\nPick-Up/Drop-Off: $1.50 per day\nDiscounts for multiple dogs.\n\n\nLocation & Community:\n\nThe daycare will be in an area where there are no other doggy daycare services nearby, so residents typically have to drive about 20 minutes to find one. There was one business in the area, however, they closed down a while ago. It\u2019s a semi-middle-class neighborhood with a lot of military families/ retired military members (stable income), so I believe they would be willing to spend extra on their pets. As a resident myself, I\u2019ve noticed a lot of dogs being left alone all day, and I think there\u2019s a real demand for this service.\n\nAny advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!\n\n ",

            "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nI work full-time as a Lean Management Project Manager in logistics, but over the years, I\u2019ve realized that I have a strong talent for Excel VBA programming.\n\nIt started during my master\u2019s thesis when I optimized a transportation network using VBA and mathematical algorithms. Later, at Amazon, I built tools to improve conveyor efficiency, simplify workforce planning, and even optimize pick paths in a 6,000-pallet amazon warehouse (actually I was just responsible for people management, but whatever).\n\nI recently switched jobs and became a project mamager in logistics, thinking I had left VBA behind, but I ended up developing an automation tool for invoicing and replacing a \u20ac1,000-per-license process measurement tool in just two days.\n\nNow, my sales/marketing director is asking for a reporting automation solution, and I realized \u2014I genuinely love doing this and seem to be pretty good at it. Unlike typical IT specialists, I understand business processes, speak the language of operations, and can communicate well with non-technical stakeholders.\n\nSo, I\u2019m wondering:\n\nHow can I turn this skill into a profitable side business?\n\nWhere can I find companies that need these kinds of solutions? Most of the people that I talk to do not even think about how and that their everyday 1 hour task can be reduced to 15 seconds.\n\nShould I start with one-off projects or work toward a standardized product?\n\nHas anyone here successfully monetized VBA or similar automation skills?

Perhaps it\u2019s just my perception, but I\u2019ve observed that quite a few of them seem to drink frequently \u2014 sometimes excessively. Interestingly, some even seem to connect better or become more approachable after a few drinks. Despite this, their drinking habits often go unnoticed or unchallenged, likely due to their success.\n\nOn a personal note, I've found that drinking in moderation fits neatly into my routine. I stick to specific times, usually between 6 PM and 8 PM, to avoid disturbing my sleep. I maintain daily workouts, my clients are happy, and my business and team are improving. In the evenings, I take time for myself\u2014whether it's playing guitar or watching a series \u2014 with 2 to 4 units of good quality vodka mixed with orange juice. Despite this regular habit, I wake up without hangovers and find my physical stamina improving.\n\nYet, a small part of me wonders: am I slowly heading down a dangerous path? My rational side suggests this could become a slippery slope toward alcoholism, though I genuinely feel more stable and fulfilled than ever, and those around me have noticed too.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from other entrepreneurs:\n\n* Have you found yourself adopting similar drinking habits?\n* Did you manage to maintain control, or did you eventually face issues?\n* Were there moments when you thought you'd found your perfect routine, only to realize later it wasn't sustainable?\n\nLooking forward to hearing different perspectives from those who've been through this journey.",

            "description": "\nOne of the biggest reasons startups fail isn\u2019t a lack of a great product\u2014it\u2019s a lack of planning, execution, and adaptability. We worked with an app startup from its early days, helping with business planning, market research, and strategic growth, ultimately leading to 1M+ users. Here\u2019s what we learned and what every business (especially apps) should focus on.\n\n**1. A Business Plan is Non-Negotiable**\n\nMany founders treat business plans as a box to check, but a well-structured plan is a roadmap to success. It\u2019s not just about impressing investors\u2014it\u2019s about forcing clarity on your strategy. Key elements every business plan should have:\n\t\n\u2022\tProblem & Solution \u2013 Clearly define the problem you\u2019re solving. If you can\u2019t summarize your value in a sentence, it\u2019s too complicated.\n\t\n\u2022\tUnique Value Proposition (UVP) \u2013 What makes you different from competitors? A small edge isn\u2019t enough\u2014you need a clear differentiation.\n\t\n\u2022\tGo-To-Market Strategy \u2013 How will you acquire your first 1,000 users or customers? Organic growth? Paid ads? Influencers? Partnerships?\n\t\n\u2022\tMonetization Model \u2013 What are your revenue streams? Subscriptions, one-time purchases, freemium models? Most startups underestimate customer acquisition costs and overestimate willingness to pay.\n\t\n\u2022\tFinancial Projections \u2013 A rough estimate of revenue vs. costs. If you\u2019re burning money too fast, even the best idea can fail before it gains traction.\n\nKey takeaway: Your business plan should be a living document that evolves as you get more data\u2014not something you create once and forget.\n\n**2. Market Research is More Than Just Checking Competitors**\n\nMost startups make dangerous assumptions about their market. Instead of just looking at competitors, we:\n\t\n\u2022\tConducted direct user interviews to understand pain points\u2014no guessing, just real feedback.\n\t\n\u2022\tAnalyzed search trends & behavior data to see what users are actually looking for, not just what competitors are offering.\n\t\n\u2022\tTested different pricing models & features through surveys, fake landing pages, and A/B tests before full development.\n\t\n\u2022\tLooked at competitor gaps, not just strengths\u2014what are customers complaining about in reviews? That\u2019s an opportunity.\n\nKey takeaway: A \u201cgood idea\u201d isn\u2019t enough\u2014you need data-backed validation to ensure demand. The best businesses solve urgent problems that people are already searching for solutions to.\n\n**3. Marketing Isn\u2019t Just Ads\u2014It\u2019s Positioning, Retention & Virality**\n\nA big mistake we see: Startups burn money on ads before fixing their retention problem. Here\u2019s what worked instead:\n\t\n\u2022\tPositioning & Messaging \u2013 Before spending a cent on ads, we refined the core message to make it instantly clear why users should care. Confusing messaging = wasted ad spend.\n\t\n\u2022\tReferral & Viral Loops \u2013 We incentivized users to invite friends, rewarding them with in-app perks. If 1 user brings 2, growth is exponential.\n\t\n\u2022\tCommunity & Social Proof \u2013 We engaged with early users in online communities (Reddit, Discord, niche Facebook groups), making them feel like part of the brand, not just customers.\n\t\n\u2022\tContent Marketing & Thought Leadership \u2013 Instead of just running ads, we created valuable content that positioned the brand as an industry authority. Trust converts better than discounts.\n\nKey takeaway: Marketing isn\u2019t just about acquiring users\u2014it\u2019s about keeping them and making them bring others. Growth comes from a mix of product experience + strong messaging + strategic distibution.\n\n**4. Growth Requires the Right Metrics (Not Just Vanity Metrics)**\n\nMany founders obsess over vanity metrics (likes, downloads) instead of the numbers that actually matter. Here\u2019s what we tracked instead:\n\t\u2022\tUser Retention & Churn Rate \u2013 How many users are still active after 30 days? A high churn rate means you\u2019re filling a leaky bucket\u2014fix the product before spending more on marketing.\n\t\u2022\tCost Per Acquisition (CPA) vs. Lifetime Value (LTV) \u2013 Are you making more from each user than you spend to acquire them? Many businesses don\u2019t realize they\u2019re scaling at a loss.\n\t\u2022\tActivation Rate \u2013 What percentage of new users take a meaningful action (like making a purchase or completing a key step)? If people sign up but don\u2019t engage, something\u2019s broken.\n\t\u2022\tConversion Funnel Optimization \u2013 We A/B tested everything from onboarding screens to CTA buttons, because small tweaks can make or break conversion rates .\n\nKey takeaway: Scale isn\u2019t just about acquiring users\u2014,it\u2019s about ensuring they stay, engage, and convert profitably.\n\n**Final Thoughts\u2014**\n\n\n\nHaving a great product is just step one. The difference between startups that succeed and those that fail isn\u2019t just fundingit\u2019s strategy, execution, and constant iteration.\n\nThe objective of this post is not to promote but educate.\nIf you have any questions about business planning, marketing strategies, or growth tactics, feel free to ask! Happy to share insights.\n\n",

I make just below average income here in my country.\n\nI do Meta ads, CRM systems, automation, websites and so on and consult clients in general business.\n\nI constantly feel insecure of what I should do, how I should do it, am I good enough? \n\n I have a gazillion ideas but I can\u2019t seem to move fully on one of them because WHAT IF it\u2019s not the right one?\n\nCould be something as simple as should I make content? Should I make it so it fits my native language or in English?\n\nWhat product should I make? I run a lot of ads for people but sporadically solve other problems like CRM and automation. Should I package it into one defines service to be more competitive?\n\nClients are generally happy and stay for years although I haven\u2019t actually formally tied them to anything other than monthly. Yet, when I try to sell my service I quickly fall into \u201cone of those\u201d bucket, which I also do understand because everyone and their grandma has some kind of ad service these days. \n\nI\u2019m considering making a free learning platform and use it as a lead magnet: is it a waste of time? Can I make it good enough? Am I too late?\n\nHow do I get unstuck? I feel like I\u2019ve wasted at least a year with my bullshit mindset, surviving but not thriving. Not sure what I\u2019m looking for but if anyone else broke out of this kind of thinking I\u2019d love to hear it\n\n\ud83d\ude4f thank you, stranger ",

            "description": "I\u2019ve been dissecting landing pages for newsletters lately and noticed three recurring formats that consistently perform well. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how they work and the psychology driving their effectiveness:\n\n**Outcome-First Approach**\n\n*Example*: \u201cGet \\[X Tangible Skill/Benefit\\] in \\[Time\\] for Free. Join \\[#\\] \\[Audience\\].\u201d\n\n*Why it works*: Zero fluff. It answers \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d immediately with a clear benefit and urgency (\u201cfree\u201d + time constraint). Social proof (\u201cJoin 200k marketers\u201d) adds legitimacy.\n\n**Learning-Centric Framing**\n\n*Example*: \u201cLearn \\[Topic\\] in \\[X\\] Minutes/Day. Get \\[Resource\\] to \\[Outcome\\]. Trusted by \\[Companies\\].\u201d\n\n*Why it works*: Targets busy professionals with bite-sized promises (\u201c5 minutes/day\u201d). Name-dropping recognizable brands (e.g., NASA, OpenAI) builds instant trust. Bonus points for pairing with a lead magnet (e.g., \u201cfree ChatGPT guide\u201d).\n\n**Identity Shift Pitch**\n\n*Example*: \u201cYou\u2019re About to Become \\[Desired Identity\\]. Get \\[Resource\\] to \\[Outcome\\].\u201d\n\n*Why it works*: Taps into aspiration. Phrases like \u201cBecome a Data Pro\u201d or \u201cMaster AI\u201d frame the newsletter as a stepping stone to a new self-image. The \u201cTrusted by \\[#\\] readers\u201d line reinforces safety in numbers.",

This app would connect you with truck owners in your area so that you/they can drive the truck to pick up your furniture ASAP.\n\nFeatures and differentiators of this app/business compared to competitors:\n\n* There would be inputs as there are with UShip and Dolly for the set-up (i.e. furniture type, size, location)\n* Help would be optional, unlike Dolly, where 1 helper is required. The buyer can bring their own help, or ask help from the truck driver.\n* There would be more communication with available truck owners to settle prices and details\n* The buyer can have the option to drive the truck themselves\n* Ideally this would work with much greater speed, and be cheaper than competitors who require scheduling ahead of time, generating quotes that are often too expensive\n\n",

I've come to know about these gaps through past roles that I held; the plug was pulled because time-to-market was large and it also needed a lot of investment.\n\nFrom what I've come to see in the market, developing it (while I'm still employed) is the best course of action. At the same time, I want to position myself in the best way possible to mitigate issues I see down the road eg the product gets offered by another company before I finish it, I offer it to the market but someone puts together a better version and sells it cheaper, it takes too long to sell it, etc.\n\nI wanted to know how everyone else goes about developing the product and, more importantly, how you sell it. \n\n* Do you participate in events to better understand market needs?\n* Are you building the product based on your past roles and the need you've seen in the market?\n* How are you selling the product (or planning on selling it when the product is ready)?\n\nFor more context, the product I have in mind is a mix of hardware and software which will have its own set of challenges. It may be offered as a service or may be sold as a kit where the customer gets a training package on how to use it. Lots of details to finalize.",

You send the data (via API or one of our SDKs) to the Chirpier service, and Chirpier handles the rest: managing and automating your own data-pipeline, out-of-the-box charts updated in a browser frontend updating via web-sockets, real-time monitoring with configurable alerts, all within a user-friendly interface. You can then customize dashboards, and set up alerts.\n\nI'd like to hear from people in the startup world about their experiences trying to get real-time data out of their applications.

Later, I reached out to Company B, and we settled on a price of $5, which offers me a higher profit. The process with Company B has also been more straightforward, and we've already reached an understanding.\n\nMeanwhile, my discussions with Company A are still ongoing, but their workflow is more complicated. They have been nice to me from the start, but from a business perspective, working with them would be more complex.\n\nHow should I communicate to Company A that I\u2019ve already made progress with Company B, whose pricing is more competitive and workflow is simpler, so I\u2019m considering working with them instead? Should I let Company A go, or should I let them know they need to be more competitive?\n\nAdditional context: Company B was very excited about my product when I introduced it and is interested in securing an exclusive partnership, but we haven\u2019t signed any official agreement yet.

I did have one guy reach out to tell me my site was ugly and another one who told me I was going to fail regardless but I still wish more people discouraged me. \n\nI was 20 years old. I was unemployed. I've been looking for a job for the last four months and couldn't find one, so when tax season came along and my mom gave me some of her refund, I decided to use the money to start a data marketing website like Survey Junkie or Swagbucks. I thought maybe I was meant for entrepreneurship or taking a non-traditional way to get poverty.\n\nI realized that creating my website was a lot harder than I could've imagined so I had to build a team of volunteers just to get the website off the ground. I was surprised that I was able to do this... My team was very dedicated to my vision. A couple people were naysayers and on top of that my website was ugly but me and my team were going strong. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to shut down the project because I just didn't have the money to keep going and people were telling them website was ugly and destined to fail. . Despite weeks of hard work my website was still ugly. I didn't want to reach out to more volunteers since I feel bad I couldn't pay anybody on my team.\n\n\nI don't know what to take from the story. I guess you could say I I was a dumb teenager with a dream.  instead of going to college and saving the money/ trying to get a job I chose to try to start a business that eventually failed. \n\nI'd love to hear more stories from you guys. Might make me feel a little better about this costly mistake I made.",

            "description": "As someone who's worked closely with multiple early-stage founders, I want to share the most effective system I've developed for turning startup ideas into real, validated products.\n1/ The Problem Discovery Mindset\nMost entrepreneurs fall in love with their solution before understanding the real problem. The most successful founders are obsessive problem detectives.\nKey strategies:\n\nSpend time deeply embedded in your target community\nLook for problems people are already trying to solve manually\nIdentify places where people spend time or money on imperfect solutions\n\nPro tip: The best problems are those causing genuine frustration, not just mild inconvenience.\n2/ The Customer Interview Framework\nForget asking \"Would you use this?\" Your interviews need to be a surgical investigation of user pain points.\nEffective interview approach:\n\nUse open-ended questions\nAvoid leading the witness\nFocus on understanding their current workflow\nExplore both emotional and practical costs of their problem\n\n80% of breakthrough insights come from what users DON'T directly say - the subtle frustrations between their words.\n3/ Rapid Validation Without Building\nBefore writing a single line of code, create a \"fake door\" MVP:\n\nBuild a hyper-focused landing page\nClearly articulate the value proposition\nAdd a waitlist or pre-order option\nRun targeted ads to your ideal customer segment\n\nCritical validation metrics:\n\n40%+ of interviewed users recognize the problem\n20%+ actively searching for solutions\n10%+ willing to pay immediately\nLanding page conversion above 5%\n\n4/ The Condensed Validation Timeline\nTraditional MVPs take months. Modern founders validate in weeks:\n\nWeek 1: Deep problem research\nWeek 2: User interviews (target 20+ conversations)\nWeek 3: Solution design based on interview insights\nWeek 4: Landing page + initial market testing\n\nRemember: Your first version will be wrong. The goal is to be less wrong with each iteration.\n5/ Building in Public: Your Competitive Advantage\nThe most successful founders:\n\nShare their journey transparently\nDocument learnings publicly\nInvite feedback from potential users\nTurn the validation process into a marketing opportunity\n\nBy building in public, you're not just validating a product - you're building a community around your solution before it even exists.\nBonus Insight: Most founders skip these steps and wonder why their product fails. Don't be that founder.",

            "description": "After years of working with D2C brands, I\u2019ve discovered that simply spending on ads won\u2019t magically drive sales. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from watching brands succeed \u2013 and struggle \u2013 in real time:\n\n1. **Ads Reflect Your Reality:** Ads only amplify what you already are. If you have a great product and genuine customer value, well-targeted ads will boost your reach. But if the core product or experience is lacking, no amount of ad spend will save you.\n2. **Your Offer is Everything:** The winning formula isn\u2019t just the product\u2014it\u2019s the complete offer. I\u2019ve seen that success comes when you nail the three key elements: a solid product, a compelling discount (if applicable), and an outstanding customer experience. Figure out your true value proposition early on; it\u2019s the foundation for sustainable growth.\n3. **Be Authentic on Social Media:** Stop treating your channels like a polished brochure. Let your team\u2019s personality, behind\u2011the\u2011scenes moments, and genuine customer stories shine through. Early on, don\u2019t stress about perfection\u2014authenticity builds trust, and trust leads to loyalty.\n4. **Focus on the Entire Funnel:** I\u2019ve learned that a great ad isn\u2019t enough if your funnel leaks. Test every touchpoint\u2014from landing pages to checkout\u2014to ensure that once you capture attention, you convert it into real sales. Listen to customer feedback and iterate quickly; sometimes small tweaks make a big difference.\n5. **Build Community, Not Just Traffic:** While paid channels have their place, the long-term magic happens when you build a genuine relationship with your customers. Engage with them, ask for feedback, and let them help shape your brand. This not only drives repeat business but creates passionate advocates for your brand.\n\nThese insights have come from years in the trenches with D2C brands\u2014seeing firsthand that a great product, a clear offer, and authentic engagement are irreplaceable. If you\u2019d like a free audit of your funnel or want to chat more about these ideas, drop me a DM. I\u2019m always happy to share what I\u2019ve learned.\n\nStay real and keep building",

            "description": "Hey Everyone!\n\nI recently had a big realization about effort and impact when it comes to startups. I spent a ton of time and energy building a mini product : crafting the content, refining the design, making sure it was perfect. But when it came time to sell it, I barely put in any effort. I just put it out there and hoped people would find it. ...Spoiler... they didn\u2019t.\n\nThat experience made me understand something crucial: building a great product is only half the battle. The other half, the part I neglected, is marketing. If no one knows about what you\u2019ve made, it doesn\u2019t matter how good it is. In a startup, effort needs to be distributed wisely. It\u2019s not enough to go all-in on the product and leave marketing as an afterthought.\n\nI call this the\u00a0Rule of 99% Effort. if I spend 99% of my time building and only 1% promoting, I\u2019m setting myself up for failure. A great product without visibility doesn\u2019t go anywhere. Now, I\u2019m shifting my mindset. Instead of focusing almost entirely on creation, I\u2019m making sure I put just as much effort into getting it in front of the right people.\n\nWith Typogram, I don\u2019t want to make the same mistake. I know I need to push beyond my comfort zone and market as aggressively as I\u00a0build my product. Because at the end of the day, the best product in the world won\u2019t succeed if no one knows it exists. I hope you can join me on this journey to push yourself beyond your fears and I would love to hear how you divide your time on these two task!",

I dont wanna be the old guy telling any tragic stories with with facts that I learned along the way and that literally everybody knows by now. Because when I first started out, I was doing the same dumb mistakes.\n\nIf you do email marketing or cold calling, everyone knows that you need to have painpoints in hand. But just having general branchspecific painpoints is simply NOT enough.\n\n* Learn everything about your target. Focus on weaknesses! If you are selling a service, focus on incidents in the target company or competitors that might have happend. Focus on economic difficulties that your target might have! Use everything possible to make sure you have the informations to make an email or a call impossible to refuse.\n* Because Step one is so difficult and time consuming, KEEP YOUR VOLUME DOWN! Don't send mass emails, do proper and clean prework so your final work can use that as a base. The better your base is, the more effective the marketing.\n* Money is an accelerator. Sure we all know that. But YOU DON'T NEED A TON OF MONEY to do good marketing. Keep your heads down and make sure you reach your targeted audience. \n\nI\u2019d be happy to share some insights or answer any questions you have about how data can boost your marketing efforts.

Working out the back of a modified truck/van/horse box. \n\nGeographically I will be operating within the Merseyside area. \n\nAfter some initial investigation, it would seem the process isn't so straight forward & I was hoping someone would be able to give me some insight/help on steps needed to be taken to get the ball rolling. They don't make it easy! \n\nFrom my research, the following steps need to be taken;\n\n- apply for a street traders licence (consent streets). This will enable me to trade on the public highway but not on licenced streets. What's throwing me off here, is that it asks for a photo of where I will be trading, along with location. Does this mean I can only trade within that one specific spot & I'm not able to be fully mobile, dictating where I trade?  \n\n- Applying for a street traders licence. It asked for a statuary declaration certificate, exactly what is this?!?! There is minimal information online. \n\n- Applying for a street traders licence. Is this business model a vehular trading licence or static trading licence? \n\n- apply for a food hygiene licence/register a food business (free) & must be done 28 days prior to commencing trading. \n\nTo my knowledge, I can apply for the street traders side of things prior to spending any further monies, though once a licence is granted, the unit will need to be purchased in order to apply/register for the food licence. \n\n\nAny help or correction on the above is highly appreciated! \n",

            "description": "AI has been killing it as of recent when it comes to automating repetitive tasks in businesses, and I've been even more fascinated by how AI voice agents have been impacting various industries. I recently came across a case study about a voice agent that helped a hospital with appointment scheduling, cost reduction and much more. Motivated by the potential of this technology, I decided to build a similar system to see how it could be adapted for other industries.\n\nI've added the case study below so that you could see the direct impact this technology is having and how fast it is advancing in todays world.\n\n**Case Study**\n\nA multi-specialty hospital was facing a range of operational challenges such as high administrative load, limited 24/7 availability, high operation costs, patient follow ups, answering routine questions and long call wait times.\n\n**Solution**\n\nTo solve these problems, the hospital implemented an AI voice agent capable of handling various aspects of patient interaction and operations such as:\n\n* **Automated Appointment Scheduling:** AI agents seamlessly handled patient appointments, rescheduling, and cancellations. This reduced manual effort by 75%, increased appointment adherence by 30%, and allowed patients to reschedule with ease.\n* **24/7 Multilingual Patient Support:** The AI agents utilized advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to communicate in six languages. This feature eased communication barriers, leading to a significant boost in guest satisfaction.\n* **Handling Patient Inquiries:** AI agents answered FAQs about hospital services, procedures, insurance, and general health queries with speed and accuracy, improving the overall patient experience. This reduced the burden on front-desk staff by 60%.\n* **Proactive Patient Follow-Ups:** The Voice AI agents automated follow-up calls for patients post-treatment, providing reminders for medication, check-ups, and future appointments, improving patient engagement and adherence to treatment plans.\n* **Enhanced Call Routing:** AI agents routed patient calls based on specific needs without requiring additional staff. This eliminated long waits, improved call response times by 60%, and allowed staff to focus on more critical tasks.\n* **Elimination of IVR Systems**: The hospital replaced outdated touch-tone IVRs with AI agents that routed calls efficiently without requiring patients to wait in long queues or be transferred among departments. This resulted in a 55% reduction in average call-handling times.\n\n**Outcome**\n\nThe adoption of AI agents resulted in measurable improvements across various operational and patient care metrics:\n\n* The hospital achieved a 55% reduction in operational costs by decreasing reliance on human agents for routine tasks and minimizing the need for additional staff.\n* Patient satisfaction scores improved by 35% as a result of faster response times, personalized communication, and proactive patient engagement.\n* Automation of appointment scheduling, follow-ups, and call routing increased overall operational efficiency by 75%.\n* The AI agents supported 12 languages which bridged communication gaps with non-English speaking patients, further enhancing the patient experience.\n* The AI agents reduced call center wait times by 60%, significantly improving patient support and reducing frustration.\n* Appointment reminders and follow-up messages sent by AI agents contributed to a 30% reduction in missed appointments\n\nBy implementing the AI voice agent, the hospital business enhanced its customer communication and scheduling, while significantly reducing operational costs.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear some of your thoughts on this technology and how you see it impacting your and/or other industries.",

These are not in depth qualification calls. It simply gets leads on the phone, verifies if they are available right now to speak with a specialist and then will maybe ask one hard disqualification question before transferring or booking. This along with opt-in/quality data is unbeatable in my opinion and is a very real threat to the call center industry. We also use AI for SMS to either get leads on calls 'right now' or book them for an appointment. I have AI Agents calling at the scheduled appointment times as well.\n\nThere's so much opportunity right now with AI Agents and it's exciting to be on the forefront.\n\nHappy to answer any questions if you consider this interesting!",

The main benefit of using a wrapper is that you will have lower costs and get to use the latest models. This is because with most wrappers, you buy them once and then you use AI models at API prices, which are usually very low.\n\nFor instance, ChatGPT plus costs about $20 a month. When I use uncapped and ask about 100 questions daily to the latest model, my bill would be around $3 per month. And when I don't use it for a month, my bill is $0.\n\nBut to get back to the main point, I was looking for a wrapper which had a memory. Which is a handy feature of ChatGPT; it remembers stuff from previous conversations. The main benefit is that you get way more accurate responses and it remembers where you are from, what you are working on,..\n\nHowever, the problem was that there was no ChatGPT \"wrapper\" app with a memory. So that's why I've created Uncapped AI. It runs fully locally on device, is a one-time payment and all data stays on the user's device.\n\nIn addition to the memory, it has the following features:\n\n\\- You can install it as a desktop or mobile app for top notch experience  \n\\- Configure default chat profiles with instructions  \n\\- Configure default context to send with your requests  \n\\- Choose between 30+ themes\n\nI'm adding Deepseek and Gemini next week \ud83d\ude01\n\nIt's a tool for \"power users\" but also regular users who chat with AI a lot and know to work with API keys. This right now is a first version, which is going to be updated daily.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated! Thanks guys\n\nI can't add a link to my project but I have no idea how I can get feedback without posting a link \ud83d\ude02  \nLink to my project: uncapped.ai\n\nTLDR: I've build an AI chat tool called Uncapped AI (the first ChatGPT \"wrapper\" with memory) and am looking for some feedback",

            "description": "Many local businesses such as cleaning services, painting services, electrical services, locksmith services, cab services, caretaker services, mobile repair services and more, are now operating online. While there\u2019s significant competition on Google to attract local customers, I\u2019ve noticed that many websites face minor issues that make it challenging for Google to fully understand their services. This often leads to websites already ranking at local and national levels appearing higher, even for local queries, which can impact the growth of smaller local businesses.\n\nIf you\u2019re facing similar challenges, we\u2019d be happy to discuss strategies to make your website more Google-friendly. Our aim is to help ensure that, for local queries, Google prioritizes websites that genuinely provide services in that specific area.\n\n",

            "description": "After delivering 12 MVPs across iOS, Android, and web platforms in just 9 months, I wanted to share the key insights I've gained. These lessons come from working with startups and entrepreneurs who needed robust, multi-platform products built quickly and efficiently.\n1. The Discovery Phase is Everything\nThe initial discovery phase is crucial when building cross-platform products. I spend at least 2-3 deep-dive sessions with clients to understand not just features, but platform-specific user behaviors. For example, one client initially wanted feature parity across web and mobile, but our discovery process revealed that their iOS users needed specific features that wouldn't make sense on web. This insight saved weeks of unnecessary development time.\n2. Platform-Specific Architecture Decisions\nEach platform requires different architectural considerations. For iOS apps, I learned to focus on native performance and UX patterns that iOS users expect. For web applications, the focus shifts to responsive design and cross-browser compatibility. One project started as a web-only MVP but quickly needed an iOS app - having a solid, platform-agnostic backend architecture from the start made this expansion much smoother.\n3. Client Communication is a Skill\nManaging expectations across multiple platforms requires clear communication. I've developed a system using platform-specific milestones and visual progress tracking for each environment. This helps clients understand the unique challenges and opportunities of each platform, leading to better decision-making about feature prioritization.\n4. Start with a Proof of Concept\nCross-platform features need thorough validation. I now build quick POCs for critical features on each target platform. This approach caught several platform-specific issues early, particularly with iOS-specific requirements like permissions and deep linking, saving significant development time.\n5. Design Systems for Multiple Platforms\nMaintaining consistency across platforms while respecting platform-specific design guidelines is crucial. I've developed a flexible design system that adapts to both iOS and web conventions while maintaining brand consistency. This reduces design time by about 40% while ensuring each platform feels native to its users.\n6. Documentation Across Platforms\nComprehensive documentation becomes even more critical with multi-platform MVPs. I maintain separate technical documentation for iOS and web components, while keeping business logic documentation platform-agnostic. This has made both development and client handovers much smoother.\n7. Realistic Timeline Setting\nCross-platform development taught me to carefully consider platform-specific challenges when setting timelines. iOS app store reviews, for instance, need extra buffer time. Being transparent about these platform-specific considerations has led to more accurate timelines and better client satisfaction.\n8. The Power of Reusable Components\nAfter building numerous cross-platform MVPs, I've developed a robust library of reusable components for both iOS and web. This includes everything from authentication flows to payment processing systems, dramatically reducing development time while maintaining quality across platforms.",

Give the business a free website, and charge monthly (about $100 per month) for the cost of the domain, hosting, maintenance SEO optimization, and labor.\n\n2.

            "description": "Title sums it up. Back when I first decided I wanted to start my company, I got into the motivation thing. I added a lot of business accounts to my social media feeds and removed everything else. I did motivate myself and got onto it. After a while, a deleted the apps and went laser focus on my work projects. Several years have passed, I'm on business, things have been good. With some time on my hands, I've recently downloaded back the apps and, oh boy, do I cringe so hard at that content right now.\n\nMost of them sell you on the idea that being successful at business requires you to: be fit; wake up early; make your bed; medidate; work to the point of exaustion; have a family and be a model father; invest in house flipping, day trading, drop-shipping or coaching; yada yada yada.\n\nAfter a while in business, I've noticed none of this rules seem to make a difference. I've met and dealt with very different, very successful people. Most were not fit. A few liked to wake up early, others were straight up night owls. Several didn't work to the point of exaustion. Several were single or divorced, a few with of them had strained families. A few of them did make money with real state or drop shipping, but they weren't a majority. None made any money from day trading. None medidate. Almost none of them paid for coaches. Most did network, but in the context of hobbies, country clubs, niche conventions and work skill related group education. \n\nThe only things all of these real, successful people had in common is that they saw opportunities, worked hard to develop a solution (product or service), managed to raise enought capital to implement it, managed to build teams that get it done, managed to sell it to an audience, negotiated a good share of the results for themselves (shares, royalties etc.), usually spend less money than they make and keep investing time and money to make more money.\n\nNowadays, I look at the vast majority of \"business\" content these pages put forward and can't shrugg off the thought they were created with the single purpose of selling a brand, product or service to people who aspire to be in business, but don't know much about it and are gullible enough to buy it. Most of it seems to be generic advice taken from books, buzzwords and random wealth symbol flexes.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is that these business coaches/influencers seem to make most of their money \"coaching\" or \"producing content\" and rarely have managed to build a successful business outside of the coaching/influencer. I decided to call bs on it.\n\nThe thing is, I'm kind of a nerd and would actually like to consume relevant business related content. \n\nThat said, do any of you guys actually listen to any business coaches, influencers or authors? Do you think any of them actually produces quality content? If you do, would you mind to share which of them you find relevant?\n\nYour opinions are appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

On paper, I have freedom and stability, I can live anywhere, work from anywhere, but I feel like I\u2019m not fulfilling my true potential.\n\nMy dream is to build a meaningful business (or something greater than me) that helps people and that I\u2019d be proud to tell my grandkids about, being a role model for other people. I\u2019ve had some past entrepreneurial experience (sold a small business for a few thousand, started a startup that never launched), but nothing long-term and/or sustainable. After a couple of years working for others, I went into freelancing/agency work, mostly taking opportunities that came my way. Now I\u2019m trying to build a startup again, but working solo has been a struggle.\n\nOn top of that, being a nomad has made me more introverted. I thrive when I\u2019m around like-minded people, something I haven\u2019t really felt since university. I realize I need to make a change because my frustration is affecting both my work and my self-esteem.\n\nI\u2019m considering three potential paths:\n1.\tFinding a co-founder and building a real in-person startup;\n2.\tJoining a startup in SF (or another entrepreneurial hub);\n3.\tDoing an MBA in the U.S to gain more knowledge and networking with other people;\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation.

It feels like whatever I can do, someone else will outcompete me and do it 10x better and faster. I wouldn't even mind being useless if not for the fact that in our society if you are not contributing anything substantial then you will not receive anything either. So despite my disabilities and weaknesses I continue to push on simply because I have no other choice.\n\nI guess I'm just venting but also of course I'd like to hear some advice. How do you 'break through' in such an environment where the strong thrive and the weak don't while being of the weak?\n\nThank you.",

            "description": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm a software engineer and AI developer working on something great in the mobile AI space. If you have been following the trends on TikTok and similar platforms, you have probably noticed the explosion of AI apps (like Rizz AI and similar) that follow the simple \"scan \u2192 solve\" concept. These apps have been massively successful because they solve specific problems with minimal user friction.\n\nHere's what makes my project different:\n\nI have identified an unique market where there is currently zero competition for this app idea that I'm creating and the potential user base is massive - we are talking about 200M+ potential users in the US alone (60% of the US population could use this app). Even capturing just 0.05% of this market could generate significant revenue, considering similar apps typically charge $4-6 per user.\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\nA marketing partner (preferably US-based or someone familiar with the US market/audience) who can help grow this app. Initially, it requires about 30\u201360 minutes per day for content creation and posting. No experience is required. If you don't have marketing experience, don't worry. In today's marketing, passion is often more important than skills (and a bit of luck, haha).\n\n**What I'm offering:**\n\nFor now, it's a revenue share partnership. I have invested my savings into the development of the app and the necessary equipment and I'm offering a revenue share until we generate enough profit for paid positions. Once we gain traction, the goal is to transition this into a part-time or full-time role. If you have zero creativity skills, I can provide you with my automated content generation tool to assist with marketing. It is basically a script that generates the type of content that gets the most views on other AI apps promoted on social media platforms. This is also a long-term partnership, if we achieve some results but not good enough with one app, we can try a new niche or just continue on this one.\n\n**About the project:**\n\nThe app is almost complete and will likely launch in mid-February. It is a self-funded venture, meaning all profits will be reinvested into growth, including ads, revenue sharing and potentially useful tools to improve marketing. Also, the app is unique, I made a deep research and there is no similar app in this niche and it is very easy to promote. Overall, it follows a simple and effective business model with a clear monetization strategy.\n\nIf you're interested in being part of something with genuine growth potential and want to learn more, DM me. We can discuss details on Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn, anything you like. The app launches in mid-February so I'm looking to bring someone on board soon to help out.\n\nNote: I will share specific details about the niche and app functionality in private messages to protect the idea before launch.",

Things like joining engagement pods, making 50+ comments a day, and signing up for endless social media platforms can make you feel more like a marketing assistant than a creator.\n\nWhen creativity is replaced by obligations, it's easy to feel drained and defeated. You end up chasing endless tactics, which only distract you from what truly matters: your purpose.\n\nHere's a more fulfilling approach:\n\n- **Invest in Audience Growth:** Choose strategies that prioritize your time and creativity. This doesn't mean spending every waking moment in engagement groups but finding methods that genuinely give you your life back.\n\n- **Fuel Your Creativity:** Regain your time to ignite your creative spark. Once you're energized creatively, you have the foundation to make an impactful business.\n\n- **Make Real Impact:** Focus on the difference you\u2019re making in people\u2019s lives, not just ticking algorithmic boxes.\n\nInstead of relying on algorithms, consider collaborating with others who share your audience. Partnering with human collaborators provides a more meaningful connection and can amplify each other's creativity and reach.\n\nThe key is to grow authentically and ensure that every step you take aligns with your life's purpose. By doing so, not only will you ensure your growth is worth it, but also create a lasting impact.\n\np.s. if you found this content helpful you may find the content with my newsletter link in bio helpful as well.",

Part time 12 months. \n* Annual Revenue: $300-400k\n* Zero fixed costs (mostly salary and freelance)\n* Currently keeping \\~3 months of running costs in bank\n\n**Compensation Details:**\n\n* Salary offer: Median marketing salary, nothing special but OK (\\~40% lower than current comp)\n* 10% equity with yearly dividend distribution\n* Current partners take same salary level\n\n**Current Setup:**\n\n* Two current partners (one full-time, one reducing to 50%)\n* Current offer: 10% equity\n\n**My Background:**\n\n* Worked previously with one partner\n* Together we built a significant sales pipeline using our direct growth marketing approach so I do 'believe in the business' \n* Proven track record of making this specific strategy work\n\n**The Catch:**\n\n* I'll be working full-time\n* Partner 1 wants to work full time\n* Partner 2 dropping to half-time due to family commitments\n* They're offering me 10% equity for essentially replacing Partner 2's workload \n* Replacing my current salary would take 2-3 years at current revenue and my estimated growth\n* Business timeline estimated 5 years (lifestyle focused, sell and exit).\n\n**My Gut Check:**\n\n* Feels like I'm getting the short end of the equity stick\n* For 10% I would be working 2x Partner 2, for \\~1/4 of their equity, sure founder advantage etc. but I would resent that\n* Could try negotiating to 20% (15% free, 5% purchased)\n* If and big if, the business can sell for a decent amount after the 4/5 years then I would wind up on basically 40% better of each year compared to staying in my current salaried role. \n* Real unsure of the working structure and interpersonal heirarcy if someone who is minimally involved in the day-to-day has such a big chunk\n\n**Questions for the crowd:**\n\n1. Am I being unreasonable wanting more equity?\n2. How would YOU structure this deal?\n3. Would you take a salary cut for potential future growth?\n4. Red flags you're seeing?\n5. Do I just take this as a sign to do my own thing. I need the body-doubling, accountability that a partner brings, but don't see 10% as a true partnership. Just a subsudised salary. \n\nThrow your unfiltered advice at me. I'm all ears.",

I haven't yet monetized it (but there is some interest from users).\n\nWithout much marketing the tool grew to 700+ users in the last 3 months and still sees a steady flow of organic signups (between 4-15/day).\n\nThe tools brings in between 400-550 unique visitors per day (90% tool, 10% blog). The traffic can easily be increased by posting more to the blog, which ranks quite well already. On top, it is listed as the top tool in it's category by most of the big directories for API design.\n\nHowever, I'm moving on from this project as I want to focus on something new. I'm wondering what my chances of selling this project are? What would be the best place to look for a potential buyer?\n\nObviously, this would not be a huge acquisition but what would be a realistic price for such a tool?\n\nI'm hesitant to shut it down completely. It sees a ton of usage and a lot of users & companies rely on it. I'd much rather find someone to keep working on it and monetize it.  \n",

            "description": "Hi there, \u00a0\n\nI\u2019m exploring a new non-profit venture and as much as I have managed a number of online businesses and projects in the past, I\u2019ve never managed the servers directly and especially not to the size this project could be looking at. I am hoping that I can lean into the wealth of experience available here and find a person(s) who wouldn\u2019t mind guiding me a little through a few things and be my server/developer contact point while I\u2019m exploring costs and requirements for this project.\u00a0\n\nof \n\n**Questions:**\u00a0\n\nLet me get straight to the question and then I\u2019ll expand on the business venture after.\u00a0\n\nThe app I want to create will require some heavy server access and storage. \u00a0The app will be a stripped-back social media platform (very limited feature set).  I have created the table below with what I would expect to be the average customer usage and the resulting storage and transfer requirements per user per month (note, that the usage amounts may seem low, but that is how the app will operate \u2013 see further below for a quick overview of app intentions):\n\n|Action|Quantity p/mo|Transfer (MB)|Storage (MB)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Upload 3 min video|15|2700|2700|\n|Watch 3 min video|200|36000|0|\n|Upload photo|150|750|750|\n|View photo|4500|22500|0|\n|Misc browsing/data transfer||1000|1000|\n\nMy first question is does this look right to you? \u00a0And if so, I\u2019m thinking that my storage and transfer needs will cost me about \u00a30.90 per user per month.\u00a0\n\nThis venture will be a non-profit, so I will look to reduce operating costs wherever possible. \u00a0I\u2019d be looking at cloud servers to allow for the ease of scaling. \u00a0But one other option I was thinking about was using a decentralised storage solution. I\u2019ve never used this before, so in your opinion, would this be a good solution?\u00a0\n\nBy the end of year one, I would be looking for a setup that supports 100,000 users and then doubling at an absolute minimum year on year. \u00a0Do you have any idea what other server costs I would need to allow for, for example, hosting, will I need specific server packages, compute needs, security and then there are things like load balancers, etc. \u00a0I need help here to work out what the costs would be per month.\u00a0\n\nI completely understand that I will need a CTO, but at the moment, I am just going through the initial idea phase and pinning down the basic requirements and costs.\u00a0\n\nI am under no illusion how big of an endeavour this is and how the costs will escalate incredibly quickly.\u00a0\n\nAny help would be useful, thanks. \u00a0And if this does take off, I will be looking to staff up on developers both full, contract and consulting \u2013 so you never know, there may even be an opportunity here for yourselves.\u00a0\n\n**Quick overview of the concept:**\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m looking to develop a social media app that focuses on stripping out the negative effects, both mentally and socially, of social media. \u00a0This includes removing the business side of things such as influencers and company advertising and instead promoting real social connections and improved wellbeing through how the app forces the user to use it. \u00a0Additional benefits would also be advertising non-profit and charitable organisations, raising awareness, reducing fake news and promoting improved mental health opportunities.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a user-first initiative that hopes to rewrite how we use social media. \u00a0It\u2019s not a replacement for the common-place social platforms, but it is an alternative to disconnect a little and to become more responsible and aware of yourself and your usage.\u00a0\n\nThanks to anyone who has made it this far!\n\n\u00a0",

            "description": "Performing a CTR audit is one of my favorite tasks for my SEO clients because of the speed of results and the direct impact it has on their traffic. Instead of waiting months for new rankings, optimizing what they already rank for allows us to see improvements in just days. By refining title tags, meta descriptions, and search intent alignment, we can quickly boost click-through rates and drive more traffic without creating new content or building backlinks. It\u2019s a simple yet powerful way to maximize visibility and get more value from existing rankings.\n\n# Step 1: Collect CTR Data\n\n1. **Access Google Search Console (GSC)**\n   * Navigate to **Performance** \\> **Search results**\n   * Set the **Date Range** to at least **3 months** for a broader trend analysis.\n2. **Export Data**\n   * Click **Export** (top-right) to download data in **CSV** or **Google Sheets**.\n   * Ensure you include **Queries, Pages, Clicks, Impressions, CTR, and Average Position**.\n\n\n\n# Step 2: Identify Low-CTR Pages & Queries\n\n1. **Filter for Underperforming CTRs**\n   * Sort by **CTR (Low to High)**\n   * Identify **pages or queries** with high **impressions** but **low CTR** (e.g., < 3%).\n2. **Look for High-Ranking, Low-CTR Pages**\n   * Pages ranking **1-5** with CTRs below industry benchmarks indicate an optimization opportunity.\n\n\n\n# Step 3: Analyze Title Tags & Meta Descriptions\n\n1. **Check for Weak or Generic Titles**\n   * Use **Power Words** (e.g., \u201cUltimate,\u201d \u201cBest,\u201d \u201cGuide,\u201d \u201cFree\u201d).\n   * Include **Numbers** (e.g., \u201c10 Proven Strategies\u201d).\n   * Ensure **Primary Keyword** is present and placed early.\n2. **Optimize Meta Descriptions**\n   * Write compelling descriptions (120-160 characters).\n   * Use **action-oriented language** (e.g., \"Learn how to...\").\n   * Avoid **keyword stuffing**\u2014focus on engagement.\n\n\n\n# Step 4: Improve SERP Features\n\n1. **Check for Featured Snippet Opportunities**\n   * Look for queries where competitors have snippets.\n   * Format content using lists, tables, or Q&A style.\n2. **Enhance Schema Markup**\n   * Add **FAQ Schema** to boost visibility.\n   * Use **Review Schema** for product/service pages.\n\n\n\n# Step 5: Optimize for Search Intent\n\n1. **Analyze User Intent**\n   * Is the page fulfilling **Informational, Navigational, or Transactional** intent?\n   * If mismatched, adjust content to better satisfy intent.\n2. **Improve Content Format & Structure**\n   * Use **bullet points, headings (H2, H3), and visuals** for better readability.\n   * Include **FAQs** to address common user concerns.\n\n\n\n# Step 6: Enhance Internal Linking & Navigation\n\n1. **Add Internal Links to High-CTR Pages**\n   * Link from high-traffic pages to boost engagement.\n   * Use **descriptive anchor text** for relevance.\n2. **Ensure a Clear CTA**\n   * Add **buttons, bold CTAs, or links** to guide users.\n\n\n\n# Step 7: Optimize for Mobile & Core Web Vitals\n\n1. **Check Mobile Performance in GSC**\n   * Navigate to **Mobile Usability** and fix any issues.\n2. **Improve Page Speed & UX**\n   * Test with **Google PageSpeed Insights** and **Lighthouse**.\n   * Optimize **images, scripts, and lazy loading**.\n\n\n\n# Step 8: Track & Measure Improvements\n\n1. **Reanalyze CTR After 7-14 Days**\n   * Compare CTR before and after optimizations in GSC.\n2. **A/B Test Title & Meta Tweaks**\n   * Run different versions and measure improvements.",

Given their public claims about securing investor funding, it raises serious questions:\n\n* **If they raised $2.5M, why are they offline?**\n* **Are investors aware of how their funds are being handled?**\n* **Is this a case of mismanagement, or something worse?**\n* **Haven\u2019t seen any publication about this matter, why?**\n\n# Why This Matters:\n\nAlfii was featured in **business news** (for example Entrepreneur Middle East: \"We Got Funded!\" Dubai-Based HR-Tech Platform Alfii Raises US$2.5 Million In A Pre-Seed Funding Round\"), yet behind the scenes, small folks like me are left unpaid. This could indicate a broader **pattern of misconduct**.\n\n# What I Can Share:\n\nI\u2019m posting this to **warn others**, **seek advice**, and **potentially connect with others who have faced similar issues**. If anyone has insights on legal options, or if you\u2019re an investor who may have concerns, feel free to reach out.\n\nThe only thing that I barely could find is an Instagram post about this.\n\n**TL;DR** \u2013 A startup that raised $2.5M isn\u2019t paying people, has multiple lawsuits against its owner, and may have engaged in financial misconduct. Looking for advice & raising awareness.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.",

I love my idea and see a very real need for it in the market. Things are going smoothly, we are getting our first subcontractor to funnel our leads to for the work, and we have a great marketing person on board with tons of startup experience who is really taking the work well. My question to you guys is, were you anxious before the ball officially got rolling? Everything \u201cfeels\u201d right, I\u2019m not saying I know everything but all the steps we are taking make sense. Our costs are low, the most expensive parts are being done for free by my partner and myself. I\u2019m honestly just scared it won\u2019t work out, though I don\u2019t see any issues with what we are doing. I\u2019m sure we will see challenges but to be honest, I feel like we can handle it. I\u2019m just nervous about what the unknown unknowns are since we aren\u2019t live and funneling customers in yet. Anyone else have doubts like this before they started? How did you deal with them? Is this \u201cnormal\u201d? We are going in with no debt and self financing everything which is actually pretty cheap, like $300 for me and my cofounder per month with all costs included. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be anxious but I just am and not sure why. Any feedback helps, thanks!",

If you build something that has tiny startups as a target audience (aka yourself), you'll have tiny startups as customers, (aka companies without money). \n\nSo I don't think only building things you can be a power user of (from the start) is actually a good idea. That doesn't mean I advocate for building whatever you feel like but nobody wants (\"blockchain-based petsitting marketplace\"). \n\nWhat I do believe is that the best ideas usually come from personal experience. Maybe you hated building\u00a0a piece of infrastructure in your last corporate job. You know every big company needs that infrastructure and typically builds it from scratch. \n\nThat could be a fantastic startup idea! Even if your startup doesn't need that bit of infrastructure at its stage, it's probably a better idea than something tiny, poor startups need, but giant, rich corporations don't.",

            "description": "Hello,  \nAt one point in my life I had a set plan that I had been following in which to design a life that fit my values, but during 2020 the viability was called into question and I have been on bad footing, unable to find stability, since. Though I currently have stable housing without roommate, and enough in savings for a year without any income and three more years in a mutual fund. The question I need help with is about utilizing approximately $40,000 that I would like to invest into a new or existing business venture, or possibly start investing my own hand in selecting stocks.\n\nTo give context about the parameters of concepts that pertain to me, back in 2005 I graduated highschool and immediately was an entrepreneur, started a sports clothing company, was selling WoW bot accounts, ghillie suits on ebay, and graphic design commissions, and I was proficient in MX Flash. Although the first part of my life plan to start farming three years before 2012 for what I thought would be a peak oil economic collapse, and while watching 2008 unfold, along with my career in MX Flash falling flat, I started farming 2009.\n\nFrom that point I spent a total of 15 years farming, the majority of that was for my own LLC, where I was situated with leases on million dollar properties as Ag tax write off, on an elite island outside a major city, serving local high price wholesale, mainly salad mix and mushrooms, because they are fast turn around.\n\nThat was truly the best 20s I could have asked for, working mainly for myself, very healthy and was putting away $10-20k in savings/investments per year, plus was earning about $3-5k more per year, while living in a cargo trailer on dirt cheap leases. But it all came to a slow end starting in 2020 when I lost all of my wholesale overnight, and my retail exploded, which burnt me out to the point I couldnt walk, as the sole worker in my LLC. So I do not fully trust the volatility of the wholesale food industry, from a small grower\u2019s perspective, since i don't own land.\n\nSO now I am trying to figure out a way forward, because I can always farm in the future, and have taught myself hydroponics, and flat packed farm equipment, so my business is very agile and now I can grow in parking lots closer to the city for more sales opportunities, but I am not sure that is what I want to do in this current moment, because tech is exploding, and we have never had so much information available to us, it's a shame not to spend a moment in life to discover what new opportunities might be out there.\n\nI was laid off twice last year, so I've been out of work the past four months, doing thriftstore routes twice a week while making about $500+/wk, really just trying to understand what people still buy and break even, while I continue to study 3d design blender, as well as 2d digital art in the hopes that I can reconnect with my tech art past, because that is what I told myself when I was 18, that I would put off art and computers until I was past 30 and needed to do less with my body. But over the past three years, the better I get at digital art, the better Ai has been getting too. I have some mentors who might give me work and a foot in the door, but most of them are laid off, and scrounging for work if they are not on their own funded indie project.\n\nI've thought about continuing to learn 3d modeling despite Ai, and despite seeing Flash, computer program I was proficient in get removed from existence before I could really earn my money back. I assume there will always be a need for Ai models to get cleaned up, mapped and rigged, especially with AR technology coming to consumers soon, but more over it would help if I decided to go to a community college to do CNC certificates, so I can have that as a backup job on CAD at a machining warehouse and do my farm and digital art on the side, but CNC mechanics don't make a crazy amount of money and have a boss. BUT I am an inventor, and have two inventions so far, plus my ultimate goal is to one day have automated hydroponic greenhouses, using all CNC+3d printed parts to create a low time investment agriculture income, with Ai monitored greenhouse, seed to salad product that i can sell to other people, which would tie into my desire to teach people about farming too, as well as do something I enjoy, but it is not a proven concept yet.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nAnyways if you've read this far I appreciate it, I ultimately would like 3rd party feedback about how I should spend my $40k surplus cash. I originally had it saved and accessible in case I was going to lease land and start my full farm business again from scratch, but I think using the equipment and space I have, and exploring non-perishable products is a smart move for me right now. Should I invest in inventory of products to arbitrage online? Should I invest in the top index funds? Should I buy Silver? Should I invest in inventory of a new product line? Should I spend some money insuring and equipment for a landscaping company?  \n  \nI want to future proof myself the best I can as Ai unfolds, I am pretty set with an income for the rest of my life as long as I can grow food and sell it, but there are currently so many changing opportunities, I want to cast out my net and see what works with my temperment. I\u2019ve thought about getting into cyber security, or maybe be an electrician, or less staple jobs like Landscape Architech (can use art/modeling) and CNC engineer/modeler, but honestly I prefer to make a product and sell it without client service related interaction, and particularly no boss. Thank you for reading\n\n  \n  \n\n\n",

Whether you\u2019re a coffee shop, a plumber, or a boutique, it feels like there\u2019s always something keeping you from showing up when potential customers are searching for what you offer.\n\nSo, I\u2019m curious\u2014what\u2019s been your biggest challenge when it comes to local SEO?\n\n* Is it getting consistent reviews?\n* Struggling to optimize your Google Business Profile?\n* Not sure how to use keywords effectively for your area?\n* Or maybe it\u2019s something else entirely?\n\nI\u2019m genuinely interested in hearing what\u2019s been tripping up local businesses like yours. Who knows, maybe we can all learn something from each other\u2019s experiences!\n\nWhat\u2019s your story?",

            "description": "Hey friends,\n\nMy vision is to create a fun space; essentially a gaming lounge with some other elements. I still have a ways to go to figure out the details to truly be prepared to seek investment. I believe I have all the qualities I need to be successful at this, except one major one is tripping me up.\n\nBasically, I don't feel like I can commit to tens of thousands of investment in something I don't have experience with. I am quite confident in my ability to execute on this and make it successful, if only I *knew* it's actually something **I'll enjoy**, and that I won't quit over boring parts of it.\n\nMy solution to this, in theory, is simple. Just start with the **absolute smallest** model possible -- a true MVP or POC for myself. Instead of an entire lounge, how about a \"Game Night\" once a week with just a few items? Charge as little as $5-10. Try it out, do it until I pay back the investment, take it step by step while building a relationship with investors.\n\nBut it seems renting a place for an event is *extremely* not cost-effective versus leasing a space. It's like $200/4 hours for most places I can find. I don't see a bite-sized version of this experience justifying that. Or I could spend like $2,000 a month... \\~$70/day, and I could be there making it happen for 6-7 days a week. I just don't want to do it for a week and then suddenly not want to anymore. Of course, everything is cheaper at scale, but this seems kind of extreme and self-defeating.\n\nAny creative solutions on how to ease my way in? Especially, anyone with experience in angel investing? Thanks.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention. I did almost get that bite-sized \"Game Night\" started as a *free* event. There is a place near me where you can host events for free, as long as you don't charge for them. I could have tested the waters this way. Unfortunately I had to sell the few items I had prepared for it to pay for car maintenance. It was actually originally planned to start tonight. Getting the funds to start it in a small capacity for free has been challenging enough. I don't have disposable income at all.",

So, I was thinking the advertising would be tailored to these types of viewers enjoying their holidays and scaled across multiple locations to make it worth while. \n\nI\u2019m thinking to make this work I\u2019d need buy-in from multiple locations but I don\u2019t know what the potential revenue would generate and hence how long it would take to generate a return (if at all). The displays would be large and could be used for other things (such as movies, maybe gaming?? etc), with advertising tied in at the beginning or end of movies or when otherwise not use for these other activities.\n\nNot sure if I could approach an existing advertising agency that already has a large catalogue of advertising customers or if I\u2019d need to essentially become a mini advertising agency myself to make this work. \n\nYes, many factors to consider and perhaps a few assumptions could be made to estimate a range of likely revenue. \n\nAnybody play in the advertising space that might be able to guide on how to calculate revenue?

We know this with streaming social media already.\n\nBut why aren't we allowing for other brilliant developers to market their outlets and why must global ***BIG TECH*** swallow this industry?\n\nIf TikTok is banned in The States, what outlets are they going to go to?\n\nRight now is the time for a platform that can further in engaging in getting ppl to express themselves, one that is more interactive, and giving liberty to being able to think through complex topics without all the nuances.\n\nBack in the Colonial days people went to the local ***Town Hall*** in their city for discussions, debates, to be informed about what was going on in their town. ***Public Squares*** was where you got the news or view what was on the bulletin.\n\nThese were really the first social outlets, and the exchange of ideas were still really effective!\n\n***'The Town Hall'*** or ***'Public Square'*** is merely a title now for nice marketing and bears no relevance like it did as a place for the community.\n\nMost people don't want to waste time and go to their local City Hall.\n\nWhat you have now are a bunch of very influential outlets for a profile identity, connections, and expressing oneself. But there is still a barrier to involving a ***broad community**\" that is more interactive with ***streaming***.\n\nAnd as we know, these outlets get hit with so much bias and fake news and the regulators really get to determine what is seen and not seen.\n\nWe need something that can make a better difference in our society and that gives the person more liberty and transparency to engage. And especially independent from ***BIG TECH***.\n\nA platform that takes all the great benefits, brings together ***live streaming***, ***shorts and clips***, and categories all into one. \n\n***A reply to a clip/short with a clip/short*** in a feed that can be replied, shared and liked. ***Categorized and hashed#***. A ***Multi streaming-to-streaming interface***. ***Solo recorded videos and shorts***.\n\n\nA platform where one can build a ***profile*** and ***share*** but also be just as involved ***virtually*** with their community ***locally*** and ***beyond***.\n\nThese are just tidbits of ideas here. But the overarching goal behind this is to create a more engaged and informed community beyond just text and images, for people to connect with others in their area, but also use this as a way to bring back ***The Town Hall*** and ***Public Square***, but virtually and have more flexibility with the exchange of ideas.\n\nPublic Debate is a lost art and is confused with opinionatedness and argumentation or for the most scholarly elite. With such a platform, civil argumentation interactively on news, social issues and politics could be categorized within the virtual Town Hall allowing for users to connect with others locally in their area and beyond.\n\nA revitalizion of ***The Town Hall*** or ***Public Square*** virtually for the modern age. And one that could actually benefit society more positively as a tool of teaching in constructive criticism. This could actually help produce a more rational society. \n\nOr if those categories within ***The Town Hall*** section aren't for the user, they can still use all the basic elements of the platform for their own discussions and shares of their choice.\n\nA truly ***all-in-one platform*** that brings together all the best of social media but that can produce a healthier society.\n\n***Let me know your thoughts and feedbacks.***\n\n***Anyone that would like to network with me on this please Direct Message***\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "This will probably be a controversial take, but I've concluded that simply \"accepting\" all chargebacks may actually be the best course of action for entrepreneurs. Here's why:\n\n\\#1) According to Stripe, it doesn't matter if you win or lose the dispute -- the mere fact that a dispute was filed counts against your account standing in either outcome:\n\n*\"Accepting disputes: You can accept a dispute, effectively agreeing that the cardholder\u2019s reason for the dispute is valid. Accepting a dispute isn\u2019t considered an admission of wrongdoing and is sometimes the most appropriate response. The customer has already received their refund through the dispute process\u2014\u2013if you agree with the refund, it\u2019s best to accept the dispute. Take this action if you don\u2019t intend to respond and submit evidence. Although accepting disputes doesn\u2019t negatively affect your business any further, it\u2019s not a viable alternative to an effective refund or returns policy.* **Dispute activity is calculated based on the disputes received, not won or lost**, *so dispute prevention is critical....* **Remember, the card networks don\u2019t consider how many disputes you win or lose, only how many you receive\u2014a withdrawn dispute still counts as a dispute.***\"*\n\n2) Taking the time to meticulously prepare and compile all of the evidence required to adequately respond to a dispute will likely require hours of work -- hours that could better be spent building and improving your business, AND taking action to prevent future chargebacks by improving your business systems, transparency of communications, customer service efforts, etc. Depending on the dollar amount and your effectiveness as an entrepreneur, you can likely make way more money with those hours spent productively on your business than you could earn back by winning the dispute.\n\n3) Even in the best of circumstances, you have maybe a 50/50 chance of winning the dispute. I again quote Stripe on this point:\n\n*\"The following table shows the expected win percentage for each ranking. Even in the most favorable cases, it\u2019s very difficult to overturn a disputed payment.\"*\n\n|Dispute Win Likelihood Ranking|Chance of Winning the Dispute|\n|:-|:-|\n|5 dots|60%|\n|4 dots|40%|\n|3 dots|25%|\n|2 dots|15%|\n|1 dots|5%|\n\n4) My biggest argument AGAINST a blanket policy of just, accepting all disputes would have been: \"By doing so, it's a de facto admission of wrongdoing, and not 'fighting against the claims' would make your account look worse, and sketchy, so you'd be more likely to get banned by your payment provider.\" However the quote from Stripe in point 1 seems to indicate... it doesn't really work that way. Since your dispute SUBMISSION rate (not your dispute win vs. loss ratio) is what fundamentally matters and will compromise your account standing.\n\nI'm a big advocate of streamlining processes as much as possible, and reducing the cognitive load spent on things that don't really matter much, and that take up tons of time and mental energy. Carefully compiling reams of evidence, like a courtroom lawyer, to challenge a very rare dispute, seems like a prime candidate for something that would take a ton of time, be unlikely to end in your favor anyway, and make zero actual impact on your account standing -- since the filing of the dispute ITSELF is what compromises your payment provider account standing. So WHAT'S THE POINT?\n\nAssuming your dispute rate is low, the money lost likely isn't going to have any ruinous impact. If the rare dispute has the potential to sink your business, you're fucked anyway as far as I'm concerned. So, aside from the \"moral victory\" of standing up against what you believe is a phony dispute... from a practical standpoint? I think the best move, whenever you get a dispute, is to simply accept it, move on, and focus your time and energy on continuing to grow your business, improve your customer service, and do anything/everything to reduce the number of disputes you receive in the future.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

            "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm an app developer, and lately, I've been catching myself doom scrolling way more than I\u2019d like. Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and endless feeds just eat up my time, and I end up feeling drained instead of productive.\n\nSo, I had an idea\u2014what if I build an app that blocks users from certain apps (like Instagram or any app they choose) when they reach a set limit? But I don\u2019t want it to be just another generic app blocker.\n\nIf you were to use an app like this, what features would you want? Here are some I\u2019m thinking of:\n\n* **Time-based blocking:** Set daily limits on specific apps.\n* **Scheduled blocks:** Block apps during certain hours (e.g., work or study time).\n* **Hard mode:** Once a limit is reached, the app can\u2019t be unlocked easily (or requires an extra step like solving a puzzle).\n* **Accountability mode:** Set a trusted friend who gets notified if you try to disable the block.\n* **Productivity boost:** Suggest an alternative productive task when you hit your limit (e.g., read a book, do push-ups).\n* **Customizable rules:** Different blocking rules for different apps (e.g., 30 min on Instagram, 1 hour on YouTube).\n* **Progress tracking:** Show how much time you\u2019re saving and how your habits are improving.\n* **Whitelist mode:** Only allow essential apps during work/study hours.\n* **Emergency access:** One-time unlocks per day if needed but with a small delay to prevent impulsive overrides.\n\nDo you think this is a good idea? Would you use something like this? And what features would make it actually useful instead of something you\u2019d just uninstall after a day?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! \ud83d\ude80",

You know the whole \"my job is getting replaced by AI\", something along that line. \n\nBut then a lot of unexpected things happened... \n\nThe article went viral and a ton of business owners emailed me asking me to create AI agents for them. Some of the asks involved medical billing agents, roadside assistance agents, replacing receptionist at dental offices agents, etc. The demand was INSANE. I was not expecting this. After about 15 calls in the span of one week, I ended up securing a couple of contracts that ranged in low-mid 5 figure deals. Again, I totally was not expecting this. \n\nI mean I knew AI agents and web agents are cool as I have been doing it for 4+ years now, but I guess now EVERY one wants to hop on the wave. I also got a lot of questions asking me if people's personal jobs were in jeopardy. Like a LOT of questions. I had to be honest and say yes because the truth is a lot of these agents that I have built or seen others build are very very powerful. Let's take Voice AI for example. I have created an AI voice agent that is able to take on dental patients calls, record their information, update the info in a CRM, and even perform follow ups with said patient. I'm not an expert on dental receptionist work, but this definitely sounds like their entire job being handled by an AI agent. It's a bit scary but I can't bite the hand that feeds me. \n\nTransparently I believe I have made over quarter a million with my work in agent development and I am forever grateful. But it does not hide the truth that building AI agents is also putting a lot of people's jobs at risk. Kind of a double edged sword and then there is the whole questions of ethics. But at the same time, the world is advancing and those who are able to adapt with this AI revolution are the ones who are going to succeed. \n\nAll of the different business owners that have came to me since the article got released have proven to me that there are many who are looking to adapt by adding agents in their own workflows. And that is THE way to grow your business in 2025. Since this is a community of entrepreneurs, I honestly would love to hear your thoughts on AI agent development and if you thin what I am creating is \"bad.\" \n\nP.S. I can provide the link to the article for anyone who personally asks as I know including links in post is looked down upon",

Feels like I'm mostly either paralyzed and not doing anything or just wasting time and checking stats, or I'm throwing stuff at the wall having no idea what this stuff is or if it's even the right wall.\n\nI wanted  to ask if anyone else has something like this going and would also like to ask advice if there's anyone who has overcome this strange block. Thank you.",

Otherwise, you'll be ignored.  \n\nSo, how do you start a business for less than $5,000?  \n\nLet's roll with an example. Shall we?\n\nLet's say you want to start an online makeup store.  \n\nWhat's the first thing to do?  \n\n\"Oh, maybe I buy some makeup, find storage for it, register my brand, make a logo, hmm...\" \n\nHold it there. You know how much all that costs?  \n\n\"Hmm, a lot, I guess.\"\n\nYeah, sure it does. \n\nYou already started putting money in, without making any money.\n\nWhat if the idea was shit?\n\nWhat if the market doesn't need you?\n\nDo you want to burn a $200K for something that possibly won't get you any return?\n\n\"No...\"\n\nGreat, I didn't think Soo.\n\nOkay, how about this: Start a website, set up all the deliverables on it (don't buy them yet), and start running ads or going organic on TikTok and Instagram.  \n\nThis way, you've cut down all the unnecessary liabilities that would just eat you alive.  \n\nNow, you're only spending about $3,000 on the website, and the rest can go toward advertising.  \n\nOnce people start making orders\u2026 then you start searching for the products.  \n\nThis way, you've minimized the risk of losing money because you've tested your idea fast.\n\nThe worst case is you don't find the deliverables and you refund your customers.\n\nRemember, you don\u2019t need all the flashy bullshit...\n\nYou only need what's necessary to start.  \n\nOne other step I like: After you've seen that your idea is working, run it through a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis to identify its strengths and weaknesses.  \n\nIf your idea turns out to be shit, just doing surface level money. start searching for buyers.  \n\nDon\u2019t get emotionally attached to your business.\n\nThat's a real killer.  \n\nYour business is either making you money, or you sell it.\n\nSoo here's what to do.\n\nFind an idea, think deeply how to cut down all the BS you don't need, make a website, ask people to buy your stuff, then only start making your stuff.\n\nOnce you make some money, run a SWOT analysis, if the idea is shit, sell it.\n\nNow, as I said, if you want to argue (which I know you're about to break your phone right now), use respectful language. \n\nOtherwise, just get out. Don't waste your time.",

The two coders (us) saw an opportunity since we lacked industry contacts and decided to build the MVP while working full-time jobs.\n\n# Challenges\n\n* The Sales guy was disengaged\u2014showed up late, took two weeks to provide feedback, and showed no proactivity.\n* The non-tech founders added little value and had minimal involvement.\n* The 2 coders worked very hard. No weekends, no social life etc\n* Midway, we presented our progress, and they blamed communication issues for their dissatisfaction.\n* We incorporated their feedback and completed the MVP.\n* The Sales guy delayed presenting it for 1.5 months. During this time, the project felt dead.\n* Eventually, the potential client said they liked the product and would pay.\n* Suddenly, everyone became interested again.\n\n# Current Situation\n\nWe reassessed responsibilities during a call:\n\n* **Non-tech founders**: Limited involvement due to their businesses; one offered to handle finance/legal, the other marketing.\n* **Sales guy**: Limited availability (9 AM\u20136 PM); plans to outsource sales calls and handle onboarding.\n\nWith such minimal commitment from the others, I feel uneasy about moving forward together.  \nWe estimate the time load to be 85% coding.\n\n# Options I'm Considering:\n\nA) Work only with the Sales guy\u2014give him 10% equity to bring clients while we handle everything else.  \nB) Keep all founders, but require non-tech founders to invest capital while coders do the work and sales brings clients, capping their equity at 10%.  \nC) Split and build the product ourselves.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!

            "description": "Hi all!\n\nI am from EU (Greece), I currently work as a cybersecurity engineer, I have previous experience as a SOC analyst and I have 3 years total of experience within cybersecurity domain.\n\nI plan to gain a few years more experience, collect a few more certifications then try to become an independent consultant, specializing in either offensive security, vulnerability assessments, Governance Risk Management and Compliance (GDPR, ISO27001 attestations), security awareness training programs or create a SaaS that offers cybersecurity services like Pentest as a Service (PTaaS) for example. I have a small network of security professionals from past and present work experience that think quite highly of me for my knowledge and services that I offer, which I plan to expand. My target audience for starters will be Small-Medium Sized Businesses (SMB), or even other professionals that have their own private practice that might want to be compliant to certain security frameworks.\n\nMy business vision is to simplify cybersecurity for common folk, as I have identified a big soft skills gap that according to my experience so far, most security professionals do not transfer their knowledge and expertise to non-tech folks clearly.\n\nI possess multi-faceted skills within the cybersecurity domain, mainly Red Teaming, Tabletop exercises and now I am upskilling in GRC.\n\nMy achievements:\n\n1. TryHackMe top 100 world (reached hall of fame at rank 46 world), Rank 1 Greece\n2. HackTheBox Rank 1 Greece\n\nCertifications:\n\n1. Comptia Security+\n2. ISC2 SSCP\n3. ISC2 CC\n\nI have a few questions about the process and possible payouts/expenses for such a project:\n\n1. How much can I charge per hour/per project? (I know that it depends on the project, I just want an estimate)\n2. What expenses does an independent cybersecurity consultant have?\n3. What are the initial costs for opening this type of business?\n4. How much capital shall I need to start?\n\nI don't mind starting the business in another country if needed be.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with cybersecurity consulting as an independent entrepreneur?\n\nWhat difficulties did you encounter?\n\nHow is the day-to-day life?\n\nAny advice is more than welcome and much appreciated! :)\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "description": "I wanna share some tips for everyone looking to expand his business but is struggling soo hard on stuff like email outreach. The irony of the story is that we are actually a German Lead Generation and Marketing Agency ourselves. So I really can imagine how people feel that don't specialize in Marketing like an Agency would. We now exist for almost 6 years but let me tell you that while having super happy clients right now this definitely wasn't always the case. I got a TON of informations partly out of this community sub and this is my way of giving back.\n\n# Tip Nr.1: Collect THAT Data about your targets\n\nEvery one says \"Knowledge is power\". Well in Email Marketing you can take this sentence by the word. If you face very low open rates, and even fewer responses... This probably is one of the reasons. It wasn\u2019t until we revamped our entire approach \u2014 focusing on high-quality data collection and personalized messaging\u2014that we saw results.  \nLet me give you an example...  \nA very big client of us is in the logistics industry, selling security devices. Well when we targeted logistics companies, we didn't just wrote them a boring letter. Our software was able to find out about the companies history, find out about incidents that the company had and use that as a pitch to gain traction. Use whatever you can to make the most out of your words! A simple \"we noticed that your company is facing security difficulties in the last year, just like the incident that happened 2019...\" is extremely difficult for a company executive than just a boring \"do you wanna buy this...\". Use the power of knowledge about a company to gain a step that others don't. It makes you just spammy.\n\n# Tip Nr.2: Don't send bulk email... PLEASE\n\nI know there are people selling email lists for cheap money. And I always get the question why not buy them? Whats wrong with them? And here is the deal. Its not even about the email lists. Some are fine, honestly. The problem is most people don't get the emails they truly need. The reason is simple, the word for it is ICP (Ideal Customer Profile). Lets say you have a have a cleaning product to sell. Your ICP could be supermarket-chains, distributors for cleaning products, small businesses or also even the end customers directly. As we are in B2B lets just stay with the first two options. Who would you target? All of them? No ofc not. But thats what most people do and its the worst mistake you can do because its a waste of money. Because in reality your true ICP is only a part of your theoretical ICP that you brainstormed. Try target small groups of a selected niche and see how things go, then document and move to the next target group. A couple hundred mails a week are enough to get all info.\n\n# Tip Nr.3: Personalization is NOT just changing the Name in the header!!!\n\nHaving variables in an email that change dynamically is not personalized by my standards. I know tools like instantly offer this but coming from point 2, you can't combine good research with a simple email. The best thing that worked for us is to have one small paragraph that is personalized and easy to change. Our software actually writes that automatically for us, but this is something that everyone can do! Even manually. Keeping your emails simple and short also makes this easier, while keeping them easy to read.  \n  \nThere is so much that I took with me over the years and I would love to to keep this discussion going, so feel free to DM me or drop a comment if you have something to add.

Non-EU students who want to study in EU and want to learn where they should apply with what requirements.

            "description": "Running a business is great, but it can be tough. You might not have enough customers. Or maybe you have to lower your prices all the time to compete. It can feel like you're stuck, especially if your business doesn't seem exciting or new. There may not be much stuff to attract customers.\n\nBut guess what? If this sounds like you, you might be sitting on a\u00a0***goldmine***.\n\nI help people with regular, \"boring\" businesses make a lot more money by implementing the value ladder strategy. I want to share it with you, too!\n\n**Here's what we'll talk about:**\n\n* Why regular businesses can be great.\n* What a value ladder is.\n* The big mistake many businesses make.\n* How a value ladder can help your business.\n* Bonus Example\n\n# Why \"Boring\u201d Businesses Can Be Better Than Fancy Startups\n\nTraditional (aka Boring) businesses are often ignored. People want to start the newest, coolest thing. But this is good for you! It means two important things. Let's ask two questions:\n\n**Question 1:**\u00a0If a business isn't new or cool, why is it still around?\n\n**Answer:**\u00a0Because people need it! If a business is still alive, it means it's helping people. Businesses that don't help people disappear.\n\n**Question 2:**\u00a0If it's a good business, why hasn't it changed much?\n\n**Answer:**\u00a0Because it's not attracting the people who only want new, shiny things. This usually means less competition for you! You can do really well because others are busy with other stuff.\n\n# The Problem: Doing One Thing and Waiting\n\nMany businesses sell only one thing to a customer and then wait for the next customer. This is a bad idea from my exposure.\n\nImagine a thirsty, tired, and hungry man named John coming into a boring store. He wants water.\n\nMost businesses would just sell him the water. They only make a little money from a bottle of water.\n\nSo how do we make more money? With a\u00a0**value ladder**!\n\n# The Value Ladder: Step Up Your Game\n\n\"What's a value ladder?\" you might ask.\n\nIt's simple: offer more things to your customers, and they'll pay more. It sounds easy, but there's a trick to doing it right.\n\nLet's think about John again.\n\nHe goes to a regular store, buys water, and leaves. He's not thirsty, but he's still hungry and tired.\n\nNow imagine John goes to a store that uses a value ladder (VL = Value laddered), Let's call it \"VL Store.\"\n\nIn a VL Store business, we could add a large banner offering free cold water and a comfortable seating area. You might wonder, \"Why offer this for free when we could charge for it?\"\n\nThe answer is simple: this serves as the first step to attracting customers.\n\nIf your business is similar to the one next door,\u00a0**what would make John choose yours?**\u00a0Maybe luck or proximity\u2014but if he was coming from the other direction or if another competitor opened before you, that advantage disappears.\n\nBy providing a compelling reason for customers to walk through your doors, we create an edge that differentiates our business from the rest.\n\n# Step One: The Free Gift\n\nThe first step should be simple and come with almost zero risk for your customers to engage with your business.\n\nNot everyone who takes the first step will move on to the second or third, and that\u2019s okay.\u00a0**The goal is to attract as many people as possible to take that initial step**, as this naturally increases the likelihood that more will continue along the journey.\n\nEven those who only take the first step\u00a0**will remember your business**\u00a0when they need the next level of value.\u00a0**We\u2019ll be the first name that comes to mind when they or their friends require your services**.\u00a0**Why**?\n\nBecause people trust their own experiences\u2014even small ones.\n\n>\n\n# Step Two: The Next Level of Engagement\n\nA vending machine stocked with fresh products\u2014but at a slightly higher price.\n\nNote: charging extra at this stage isn\u2019t always necessary; in some cases, you might even offer a discount. The key point here is understanding the psychology behind the next step.\n\n**Why would someone pay extra on the next step when they could take your free offering and find a cheaper option elsewhere?**\u00a0While it\u2019s true they\u00a0*could*\u00a0do that, the real question is:\u00a0***Would they actually go through the effort?***\n\nTo minimize the chances of them seeking alternatives,\n\n>\n\nA few extra cents is often not enough of a difference for someone to walk a mile just to save money.\n\n# Step Three: Helping More\n\nJohn's drinking his water and resting. But he's still hungry. Now imagine VL Store also has sandwiches and coffee. etc\u2026.\n\nThis kind of store already exists in some places. But not everywhere! Have you seen two similar stores, one doing great and one not? The one doing great probably uses a better value ladder.\n\n# Bonus Example\n\nA gym typically offers subscriptions and personal training at a high fee. However, by structuring a value ladder, you can attract more customers and gradually guide them toward higher-value services.\n\n# VL Gym\n\n1. **Risk-Free Entry:**\u00a0Offer a\u00a0**3-day free trial**\u00a0with a personal trainer and a\u00a0**personalized plan**. This removes any risk for potential customers and allows them to experience your premium service. Even if they don\u2019t sign up immediately, they\u2019ll talk about their experience\u2014driving word-of-mouth marketing, one of the most powerful forms of promotion.\ud83d\udd39\u00a0**Important Tip:**\u00a0Don\u2019t reveal the price of your premium offer at this stage. Let them experience the value first, so they hope it\u2019s affordable rather than convincing themselves it\u2019s not worth it.\n2. **Standard Gym Subscription:**\u00a0Provide a\u00a0**regular gym membership**\u00a0with flexible hours. To add more value, include an\u00a0**AI-powered training app**\u00a0for free.\n3. **Group Training & Follow-ups:**\u00a0Offer a\u00a0**separate subscription**\u00a0for group training sessions and periodic progress check-ins.\n4. **Dedicated Personal Trainer:**\u00a0Customers looking for more guidance can upgrade to a\u00a0**one-on-one personal training plan**.\n5. **Premium Offer:**\u00a0The ultimate\u00a0**gold package**\u2014a\u00a0**6-month dedicated training program**\u00a0that includes\u00a0**daily supplement and meal deliveries with precise doses**.\ud83d\udd39\u00a0**Risk Reversal:**\u00a0If the customer\u00a0**pays upfront for 6 months**\u00a0and follows the plan but doesn\u2019t achieve results, they get a\u00a0**full money-back guarantee**.\n\nThere\u2019s no limit to a value ladder\u2014the more steps you offer with increasing value and minimal risk, the more success you\u2019ll achieve.",

            "description": "Hi everyone! I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the difference between passion projects and startups, and I\u2019ve realized they\u2019re totally different worlds. Passion projects are all about personal interest and creativity\u2014things I work on because they\u2019re fun and exciting. If I lose interest or it stops being enjoyable, I can just walk away, no big deal. But a startup? That\u2019s a whole different ballgame. It\u2019s a serious commitment that sticks around even when things get hard or stop feeling fun.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve had some great success with passion projects. They\u2019ve gotten media attention and even opened up some cool opportunities for me. But here\u2019s the thing: none of that really prepares you for running a startup. A business requires so much more\u2014patience, consistency, and the ability to push through challenges, even when you\u2019re over it.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to go all in with\u00a0my startup. I know if I tried to treat it like a side hustle, it wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. A startup needs focus and dedication, not just when it\u2019s exciting, but all the time. It\u2019s about the bigger picture and building something that lasts. Passion projects will always have a place in my life, but when it comes to my product, I\u2019m all in, ready to see it through no matter what.",

Creating a Direct Sales funnel\nCreating a direct sales funnel, Russel Brunson style, starting with a lead magnet (ebook or webinar probably), and pitching for the upsell that would be our brand identity service.\n\nBoth options would allow us to run this consistently and regardless of content creation (after initial set of advertising creatives is generated at least).\n\nI would like to hear opinions from ppl that already implemented either, both, or at least is familiar with either.\n\nThanks everyone,\nonly by writing this here I already feel a bit less pressured - having a business is tough every now and then...",

            "description": "Hey r/Entrepreneur community,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI recently stumbled upon Alpaca, a developer-centric API brokerage platform that enables trading in stocks, options, and Bitcoin, including paper trading accounts. What sets Alpaca apart is its unique feature that empowers developers to create applications using Alpaca Auth. While there are only a few applications available on the market, each offers a subscription-based service, with most incorporating AI in some form. I believe this presents an exciting project opportunity for skilled programmers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHere's my idea: I want to create an Alpaca Connect App that discovers investment opportunities from location history and rewards members in stock for opening the app when a notification appears while at a featured location. For instance, Walgreens uses HP for their photo kiosks and Oki for their document printers. While at Walgreens, a user of our app would receive a notification about HP and/or Oki with their relationship to Walgreens and a current stock quote.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe benefit is that some investors are in search of what to invest in, and they receive new trade ideas. While the thought of \"what if the stock goes down\" exists, the idea of receiving stock as a reward for performance benchmarking offsets this concern. Additionally, for retailers or institutions, it provides more transparency into their operations and passively advertises a service. Our service may be a great alternative to present-day location-based ad marketing, being less expensive while also streamlining the journey of customer to stakeholder.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI envision a freemium business model where users of our Alpaca Connect App do not pay for the service of receiving rewards and location-based investment ideas. A value-added subscription service has not been thoroughly thought out but could include deeper insights that lead to more rewards.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this idea. Do you think it has potential? Any suggestions for improvement?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\u00a0\n\n",

We should use this time to build back what we had. I remember when the call centers were sent over seas and all the adults were mad. I remember as a GM baby everyone I knew had a family member in the big 3, then the massive layoffs because it was cheaper to manufacture in Mexico or some other country. So now we have tariffs. Why aren't we thinking to rebuild what we had when people could afford houses and could afford nice cars. The middle class was great. But, i'm an older retired woman who isn't a business person. So what I'm wondering from you people who are, is what businesses should we try to reinvest in or rebuild? (I'm thinking of my kids and grandkids future). Instead of this being so negative why shouldn't we take advantage of it and make products again and buy American? What kind of ideas can you give for people now who want to start a business? What are we lacking that will be hit with tariffs? \nThanks for your help and I hope I'm asking in the right forum. ",

            "description": "First of all, this isn\u2019t about selling you some big idea. It\u2019s about the experiences I\u2019ve faced in the last 5 years - ups, downs, and everything in between.\n\nBefore you report this, know that there's no links in here. Not even my name! \n\nSo here it goes:\n\nIn 2018, I started as a freelance content writer. It was great. I loved it so much that I built my own agency, hired 20+ writers, and brought in a partner. By 2019, we were hitting six figures. Life was good.\n\nThen AI showed up.\n\nAt first, it was just noise. But soon, clients started asking for cheaper rates because AI tools could \u201cdo the work faster.\u201d Writers got replaced. My agency? Poof, all gone!\n\nMy partner and I split (on good terms, thankfully), and I went back to freelancing.\n\nBut freelancing wasn\u2019t the same. The market had changed. I had to lower my rates just to keep clients, and it felt like I was always on my toes. \n\nOne day, I had my 'Aha' moment:\u00a0*Why am I playing the same game when the rules have changed?*\n\nAll these years, I\u2019d been bringing in clients by doing everything myself. I'm a GODAMNN Swiss Army Knife. \n\nSo, I rebranded myself as a\u00a0**creative co-pilot for founders**. I started helping founders with everything I know including marketing, writing, SEO, tech issues, you name it!  \n\nAnd it worked! \n\nNow, I help founders save 5 to 20 hours a week. I\u2019m earning more than before and honestly having way more fun.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: \n\nLife doesn\u2019t always go as planned. Sometimes, the ground shifts, and you have to adapt. AI didn\u2019t just take something from me, it pushed me to become better. \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling stuck because the world is changing too fast, take a step back. Ask yourself:\u00a0*What else can I bring to the table?*\u00a0Sometimes, chaos is just the universe pushing you to level up.",

I enjoy thinking about the impact and products I could create for an audience of 500K+ (be it physical products, in person shows, a company to one day sell for a multiple figure exit etc.) Having this vision is what got me into this space, and I believe content creation is the path I\u2019m best suited to have that vision.\n\nWhere I am now: while I\u2019m still at 200 subs, I find that I quickly get discouraged because I\u2019m not where I\u2019d like to be though I\u2019ve been at this content creation since 2017 (inconsistently though). I\u2019ve learned my lesson of being inconsistent and won\u2019t let that happen again. I know I need a mindset shift though to keep going and stay consistent. \n\nTHE question: What should my mindset be while on the road to the big vision I want: should I focus on \u201ctoday\u201d only, getting those daily small wins, and then look up one day realizing that I\u2019m where I want to be.

            "description": "Acquiring an established company can be a strategic move to expand your business portfolio, enter a new market, or leverage an existing customer base. While this process is often complex, understanding the steps involved and the key factors that influence the acquisition can make it more manageable. In this essay, we will explore various strategies and approaches for acquiring an established company, emphasizing practical steps to simplify the process.\n\nStep 1: Define Your Objectives\n\nBefore considering an acquisition, it's critical to understand why you're pursuing this path. Are you looking to expand into new markets, gain access to new technologies, eliminate competition, or leverage an existing workforce? Clarifying your motivations and goals will not only guide your decision-making process but also help you identify the right type of company to acquire. Without clear objectives, you may end up pursuing a deal that does not meet your needs or does not align with your long-term strategy.\n\nFor instance, if you want to gain access to a new customer base, you should look for a company that complements your existing products or services and offers a stable, loyal customer base. If your goal is to innovate or gain technological expertise, targeting a business with a strong R&D department or proprietary technology could be the right choice.\n\nStep 2: Conduct Thorough Market Research\n\nOnce you have defined your objectives, the next step is to conduct extensive market research. Identifying potential target companies is essential for narrowing down your search. You can start by searching for companies that are operating in the market or industry you're interested in. Tools like online business directories, industry reports, mergers, and acquisitions (M&A) platforms, as well as professional networks like LinkedIn, can be helpful in identifying potential targets.\n\nThis research should also include an analysis of the target company's financial health, market position, and reputation. You'll want to look for signs of profitability, growth, or stability. Assess the company\u2019s management team, corporate culture, and potential synergies with your existing business. Additionally, it\u2019s crucial to evaluate the competitive landscape to understand how the target company stands relative to other players in the industry.\n\nStep 3: Identify the Right Type of Deal\n\nWhen acquiring an established company, it\u2019s essential to choose the right type of deal. Several common types of acquisitions exist, each with distinct advantages and challenges:\n\n1. Asset Purchase: In this arrangement, you acquire the assets of the company (such as equipment, intellectual property, and inventory) without taking on its liabilities. This can be advantageous if you want to avoid inheriting debts or lawsuits. However, you may have to negotiate with various stakeholders for each individual asset.\n\n\n2. Stock/Share Purchase: In a stock purchase, you acquire the company's shares, effectively taking ownership of its assets, liabilities, contracts, and other obligations. This type of deal is often quicker and simpler, but it may come with unforeseen liabilities. You should ensure that the company\u2019s financial health is thoroughly assessed to avoid unwanted surprises.\n\n\n3. Merger: A merger involves two companies coming together to form a single entity, often with a shared leadership structure. Mergers can be an effective way to combine resources and create efficiencies, but they may face cultural challenges and regulatory scrutiny.\n\n\n4. Leveraged Buyout (LBO): This involves using debt to finance the acquisition of a company. It\u2019s a popular option for acquiring companies that have strong cash flow but may not have the capital to fund the purchase outright. LBOs carry more risk but can provide substantial returns if executed correctly.\n\n\n\nBy understanding these options, you can choose the structure that best aligns with your acquisition goals and financial resources.\n\nStep 4: Identify Potential Financing Sources\n\nAcquiring a company can be expensive, so securing financing is a crucial step in the process. There are several ways to finance an acquisition:\n\n1. Debt Financing: You can borrow money to fund the acquisition. This might involve traditional bank loans, bonds, or lines of credit. Debt financing allows you to retain more equity in the business, but it also carries the risk of repayment.\n\n\n2. Equity Financing: This option involves raising funds by issuing stock in your own company. It may involve bringing in outside investors, venture capitalists, or private equity firms. While this avoids the burden of debt, it can lead to a dilution of your ownership stake.\n\n\n3. Seller Financing: In some cases, the seller may be willing to finance the acquisition themselves. This typically involves the seller receiving a portion of the purchase price over time, which can be an attractive option if you don\u2019t have the full capital available upfront.\n\n\n4. Cash Flow: If the target company has strong cash flow, it may be possible to use future profits to fund the acquisition. This could involve negotiating a deal where the payment is contingent upon the company's future financial performance.\n\n\n\nEach financing option comes with its own set of risks and benefits. You\u2019ll need to carefully evaluate your options based on the company\u2019s value, your financial situation, and the structure of the deal.\n\nStep 5: Due Diligence\n\nDue diligence is one of the most critical steps in the acquisition process. This is where you thoroughly assess the financial, operational, and legal aspects of the target company to ensure that you\u2019re making an informed decision. Skipping this step can lead to unpleasant surprises and financial setbacks down the line.\n\nDuring the due diligence process, you'll want to review:\n\nFinancial Statements: Analyze the company's balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Ensure the company\u2019s revenue streams are stable, its profits are sustainable, and it has healthy margins.\n\nLiabilities: Understand any debts, pending litigation, or contractual obligations that might impact your decision to acquire the company. You want to ensure there are no hidden liabilities that could undermine your financial situation.\n\nTax Status: Review the company\u2019s tax filings to ensure that they are up-to-date and that there are no tax liabilities or issues with tax compliance.\n\nIntellectual Property: Evaluate any patents, trademarks, copyrights, or proprietary technologies owned by the company. Make sure these are properly protected and free from legal disputes.\n\nEmployee Contracts: Understand the employment agreements, benefits, and any potential labor issues within the company. Employee turnover or dissatisfaction can be a significant risk following an acquisition.\n\nRegulatory Compliance: Ensure that the company complies with all relevant industry regulations. This is especially important if the company operates in a highly regulated field such as healthcare or finance.\n\n\nA successful due diligence process will help you identify any red flags and determine whether the company is worth pursuing. It also helps you negotiate a fair price based on the company\u2019s true value.\n\nStep 6: Negotiate the Deal\n\nOnce you have completed due diligence, the next step is to enter negotiations with the target company. This is where you will agree on the terms of the acquisition, including the price, payment structure, and any contingencies.\n\nIt\u2019s important to approach negotiations with a clear idea of your budget and limits. Be prepared to discuss and possibly compromise on certain aspects, but also remain firm on issues that are non-negotiable, such as the valuation or critical contractual obligations.\n\nOne strategy is to start with a lower offer and allow room for negotiation. A fair offer should reflect the company\u2019s financial performance, growth potential, and any risks uncovered during due diligence.\n\nStep 7: Close the Deal\n\nOnce you have agreed on the terms, it\u2019s time to close the deal. This involves drafting and signing the acquisition agreement, which will outline the responsibilities, obligations, and rights of both parties.\n\nAt this stage, legal and financial experts typically step in to ensure all documents are properly reviewed and finalized. It\u2019s also common for escrow accounts to be set up, ensuring that certain payments are made over time based on the company\u2019s performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nAcquiring an established company can be a lucrative and effective strategy for growing your business, but the process requires careful planning, research, and execution. By defining your objectives, conducting thorough market research, identifying financing sources, and performing due diligence, you can increase your chances of successfully acquiring a company. The key to a smooth acquisition lies in understanding each step of the process and ensuring that you approach negotiations with a well-informed and strategic mindset.\n\nBy following these steps, you can simplify the acquisition process and increase your likelihood of success. Ultimately, the key is to maintain a clear focus on your goals and approach each step with diligence and care.\n\n",

            "description": "When I first started out I tried to sell my services to every type of business. I got some results but they weren't great. Then I made a simple change that transformed everything I focused only on recruitment and staffing firms.\n\nI started working with one firm, then another. By focusing on just recruitment firms, I learned exactly what messages worked for their market. Each new client got better results than the last because I knew their industry completely.\n\n**My strategy was simple:**\n\n* Find companies actively hiring using Sales Navigator\n* Target hiring managers at these companies directly\n* Focus on companies with multiple job openings\n* Create personalized outreach campaigns\n\nThe messages worked well because we focused on real problems. Instead of generic sales pitches, we talked about specific roles they needed to fill. Most hiring managers needed help finding candidates for tech and executive positions.\n\n**The results showed this worked:**\n\n* Firms booked 5 to 7 meetings with hiring managers weekly\n* Each placement was worth $20k to $50k\n* One firm got a contract for 12 developer roles in just 2 weeks\n* Total client earnings passed $1M\n\nWhat made this successful was smart targeting. We only contacted companies that actually needed hiring help right now. No random messaging. Just talking to people who had urgent recruiting needs.\n\nToday I use this same method to get leads in other industries. The formula is simple find companies with urgent problems, reach out with specific solutions, and focus on quality over quantity.",

Notably, Nvidia's stock dropped 17% in a single day, erasing nearly $600 billion in market value\u2014the largest one-day loss for any U.S. company in history. \n Microsoft also faced a significant decline, losing over $150 billion in market value after its cloud division reported slower growth than anticipated. \n\nGiven that DeepSeek's founder has a background in hedge funds, do you think these market movements were anticipated and leveraged through short selling?

            "description": "Let me share a personal journey that might resonate with some of you. I\u2019ve decided to change my approach to one of my key goals for this year: losing 20 lbs. Like many, I can commit to hitting 70,000 steps a week and visiting the gym three times weekly. But the hardest part for me is tackling nutrition. As a passionate foodie, sticking to a strict dietary plan becomes daunting.\n\nI had to have an honest conversation with myself: \"Is what you're doing currently working?\" The truth was, I didn't enjoy grocery shopping, meal prepping, weighing foods, or cooking. For a while, I simply went along with these tasks because it seemed like everyone else was doing them. But then I asked myself a crucial question: \"Is this truly how you want to spend your time?\"\n\nOnce I admitted the answer was no, I sought a solution. I decided to try a meal service that delivers meals 5 times a week. This allowed me to outsource a part of my goal, freeing up my time for other things.\n\nThis experience got me thinking about how it relates to other areas in life, especially our work or passions. Are you investing your time wisely or just following the crowd?\n\nFor instance, are you:\n- Posting on social media daily because it\u2019s what everyone does?\n- Engaging with content continuously without significant results?\n- Jumping onto every new platform without seeing growth?\n\nIf you\u2019re not seeing the results you want, perhaps it\u2019s time for a change. Consider outsourcing parts of your growth ambitions. \n\nFor example, instead of spending hours daily on social media hoping to gain a few subscribers, you might invest time in strategic collaborations that bring in hundreds in a fraction of the time.\n\nAt the end of the day, your goals and time are in your hands. It\u2019s up to you to make decisions that align with what you truly want.\n\np.s. if you found this content helpful you may find the content with my newsletter link in bio helpful as well.",

That\u2019s an asset capable of fueling a **$10M+ annual revenue pipeline**.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the secret? It\u2019s all in the **structure.**\n\nAfter crafting and testing **600+ landing pages**, we\u2019ve uncovered an architecture that **outperforms traditional layouts by 3-4X**.\n\nHere\u2019s the **exact copy structure** that makes it happen:\n\n# 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Visual Hierarchy Layer\n\n* **Offer Above the Fold:** Instantly communicates the **value proposition** to capture attention.\n* **Short Lead with Social Proof:** Builds **immediate credibility** and trust.\n* **Google Reviews Section:** Perfectly placed **third-party validation** to reinforce trust at a key moment.\n\n# 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Persuasion Layer\n\n* **Reason-Why Benefit Bullets:** Turns features into **tangible, outcome-driven benefits**.\n* **Dramatic Testimonial Video:** Showcases real transformation stories to create **emotional engagement**.\n* **How It Works Section:** Removes uncertainty by **clarifying the process**.\n\n# 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Qualification Layer\n\n* **Strategic Customer Callout:** Pre-filters **ideal prospects** before they opt in.\n* **FAQs:** Eliminates objections while seamlessly guiding users to take action.\n* **Final CTA Placement:** Maximizes urgency **after stacking value**.\n\n# The Results?\n\n* **27% conversion rate**\n* **$10.27 cost per lead**\n* **4,380 leads per month**\n* **$50K monthly ad spend (ready to scale)**\n* **A sales pipeline feeding $10M+ annual revenue**\n\n# The Client\u2019s Goal?\n\nThey wanted **500 leads per day** across Google & Meta. Now, they have the asset to **consistently deliver**.\n\n# The Takeaway\n\nThe sequence of your landing page matters just as much as the components themselves. Each section builds on the previous one, creating a natural momentum that drives conversion.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to scale your lead generation and revenue, it\u2019s time to rethink your landing page structure.",

This is not an Anki/DuoLingo style app, it is not just a pretty interface with some learning material.

            "description": "Just a few months ago, I ghostwrote a book for a doomsday prepper who specialized in crafting survival food kits. His business? Dead. Crickets. He had great products but zero visibility, no traction, and no way to stand out in a crowded market.\n\nThat changed in November when we finished his short, informative book\u2014just below 10,000 words on crafting long-lasting survival rations at home. Instead of selling it, he gave it away for free to everyone who signed up for his email list.\n\nThat\u2019s where the magic happened. His book didn\u2019t just attract customers\u2014it educated them. Readers quickly realized how much time, effort, and precision went into making their own survival food.\n\nThat was the gateway to the next step. Instead of spending weeks sourcing ingredients and perfecting shelf-stable recipes, they could just buy his ready-to-ship survival food kits and have them delivered in a few days.\n\nFast forward to today, February 2025 (a time when the world seems like it is in a prelude state to an apocalypse), and his business is thriving. His email list exploded, his brand became an authority in his niche, and\u2014maybe most importantly\u2014his sales tripled. All because he had a simple, focused book that built trust and proved his expertise before he even asked for a sale.\n\nThis strategy isn\u2019t just for doomsday preppers. I\u2019ve been on the frontline with dentists, herbalists, doctors, fitness coaches, and more, ghostwriting the short, focused books they use as a direct marketing tool. If you have knowledge to share and a business that needs more customers, a short, focused book might be the missing piece.\n\nCould this marketing approach work for your business? DM me. Let's talk about it.",

            "description": "The art of making money as a creator can often seem riddled with exhausting requirements. The common narrative pushes us to chase followers, join every new platform, and craft the perfect offer before thinking about sales. But here's a fresh perspective on how to navigate this journey:\n\n- **Choose a Platform You Own**: Prioritize platforms where you have control, like an email list. This enables you to maintain direct contact without algorithms getting in the way.\n  \n- **Sell on Your Terms**: Don't wait for arbitrary milestones like reaching 1,000 followers. If you have something valuable, start offering it sooner rather than later.\n\n- **Offer Possibilities**: An offer can be either your own product/service or an affiliate option. The key is to start with what you currently have.\n\nMaking money as a creator isn't about what you lack. It's about leveraging your existing resources and contacts. The focus should be on how you generate income, rather than just the amount. Here's a streamlined approach to consider:\n\n- **Minimize Social Media Dependency**: Seek ways to generate income without constant social media hustling.\n  \n- **Avoid Trading Time for Money**: Look for passive income opportunities that don't require direct time exchange.\n  \n- **Speed and Simplicity**: Aim for methods that are both efficient and uncomplicated.\n\nTransform your existing followers into a loyal audience that you own. Implement strategies to introduce a no-effort revenue stream, turning your audience into paying clients. The sooner you implement these strategies, the sooner you'll see results. \n\nTake initiative and make the decision that's right for your creator journey. Leverage your resources wisely, and you'll optimize for profit over mere popularity. Remember, speed matters \u2014 those that act promptly benefit from quicker rewards.\n\np.s. if you found this content helpful you may find the content with my newsletter link in bio helpful as well.",

Despite the arrival of other AI models like Gemini, Copilot, and Perplexity, ChatGPT continued to dominate. However, just a few days ago, China\u2019s DeepSeek was launched at a much lower cost, creating a shockwave in the industry.\n\nA Disruptive Entry in AI\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s launch had a significant impact, leading to losses in the U.S. stock market, particularly in tech shares. Reports suggest that the losses could amount to nearly $1 trillion.\n\nNVIDIA Chips: A Key Factor\n\nChips are crucial for LLM (Large Language Model) development, but the U.S. imposed restrictions on selling them to China. NVIDIA dominates the semiconductor and GPU market in the U.S., forcing Chinese companies like Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent to develop their own chips. While American companies continued to lead, DeepSeek\u2019s sudden emergence shocked the industry, raising questions about how China achieved this breakthrough without access to advanced chips.\n\nHow Did China Achieve This?\n\nAlthough the U.S. banned the sale of high-end chips to China, it allowed H800 chips due to their lower capabilities. DeepSeek reportedly utilized these H800 chips to develop its R1 model. Typically, AI models use CUDA, a programming framework for GPU processing, but DeepSeek took a different approach. Some computer experts suggest that DeepSeek leveraged PTX, an older NVIDIA program for GPU programming, as an alternative to CUDA. Since China lacked direct access to CUDA technology, they optimized older programming techniques to achieve their AI breakthrough.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cost-effective and innovative approach has now positioned it as a strong competitor in the AI industry. The big question remains\u2014Is this the beginning of a new AI revolution?\n\n",

            "title": "How to make money Passively and Online.",
            "description": "How to Make Money Online Passively in America\n\nIn today's digital age, the internet provides an abundance of opportunities for individuals to make money from the comfort of their homes. Whether you are looking for side income or a full-time income stream, the internet offers countless ways to generate passive income. Passive income refers to earnings that require little to no effort to maintain after the initial setup. This differs from active income, where you need to actively work for each dollar you earn. If you're based in America and looking for strategies to earn money passively online, this essay outlines several ways you can achieve that.\n\n1. Affiliate Marketing\n\nOne of the most popular ways to earn passive income online is through affiliate marketing. This involves promoting products or services offered by other companies. When someone purchases a product using your affiliate link, you earn a commission.\n\nTo get started, you need to join affiliate programs, such as Amazon Associates, ShareASale, or ClickBank. After registering, you can promote affiliate links through various platforms such as your blog, social media, or YouTube channel. The key to success in affiliate marketing lies in choosing a niche that interests you and resonates with your audience. Popular niches include health and wellness, technology, finance, and lifestyle.\n\nThe beauty of affiliate marketing is that once you create the content (e.g., a blog post or a YouTube video), it can continue to generate income over time as people click on your links. This makes it a great passive income option, though it requires effort upfront in creating quality content and driving traffic to your platform.\n\n2. Create an Online Course or E-Book\n\nIf you have expertise in a particular area, you can monetize your knowledge by creating and selling online courses or e-books. The educational industry has seen a significant shift towards online learning, and platforms like Udemy, Teachable, and Skillshare make it easy to host and sell your courses.\n\nCreating an online course or e-book involves creating content that can teach others valuable skills. Whether you're an expert in digital marketing, cooking, or personal finance, there is a market for your expertise. Once the course or e-book is developed and uploaded to a platform, it can be sold repeatedly with little ongoing effort.\n\nTo ensure your course or e-book is successful, focus on producing high-quality, engaging, and informative content. Marketing the course or e-book initially is crucial, but once it starts to gain traction, it can generate a steady income stream with minimal maintenance.\n\n3. Start a Blog\n\nBlogging is another great way to generate passive income online. By creating a blog on a topic you're passionate about and monetizing it with ads, affiliate marketing, or sponsored posts, you can earn money over time.\n\nTo start a blog, you\u2019ll need to choose a niche, purchase a domain name, and set up hosting. Popular blogging platforms like WordPress or Squarespace make the technical aspects of running a blog much simpler. Once your blog is live, the key to making money is attracting consistent traffic, which can take time and effort. You can drive traffic to your blog through search engine optimization (SEO), social media promotion, and guest blogging.\n\nOnce you have enough traffic, you can monetize your blog in several ways. Google AdSense is a popular option, where you earn money based on the number of ad impressions and clicks. Another option is affiliate marketing, where you promote products and earn commissions on any sales made through your referral link. With patience and dedication, blogging can become a source of passive income.\n\n4. Invest in Dividend Stocks or ETFs\n\nInvesting in stocks is a tried-and-true method of earning passive income, and thanks to the internet, it's easier than ever to get started. Dividend stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are popular investments that can provide a steady income stream through dividends, which are payments made to shareholders from a company's profits.\n\nTo get started, you'll need a brokerage account with platforms like Robinhood, E*TRADE, or Fidelity. Once you've opened an account, you can start buying stocks or ETFs that pay regular dividends. Many investors focus on large, established companies with a long history of paying dividends, such as Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, or AT&T.\n\nWhile dividend investing may require an initial capital investment, the ongoing income is passive, meaning you don\u2019t need to actively manage your portfolio on a daily basis. The key to maximizing returns is reinvesting dividends and ensuring that you diversify your investment portfolio.\n\n5. Peer-to-Peer Lending\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a relatively new method of earning passive income online, and it has become increasingly popular in recent years. This model allows individuals to lend money to other people or businesses through online platforms such as LendingClub or Prosper. In return, you earn passive income.\n\nP2P lending platforms allow you to diversify your investments by spreading your money across multiple borrowers, reducing your risk. The platform typically acts as an intermediary and handles loan origination, servicing, and repayment. You simply need to choose the borrowers or projects you want to invest in and sit back as the payments come in.\n\nHowever, P2P lending comes with risks, including the potential for borrowers to default on their loans. To mitigate this, it\u2019s important to carefully assess the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness and diversify your investments across a range of loans. As with any investment, due diligence is critical to ensure success.\n\n6. Sell Stock Photos or Videos\n\nIf you're a photographer or videographer, you can earn passive income by selling your work on stock photography websites. Websites like Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, and iStock allow you to upload your photos and videos, which are then licensed to people for various uses, such as in marketing campaigns, websites, or print materials.\n\nOnce your content is uploaded to these platforms, it can continue to generate income whenever someone purchases a license for your work. This is a great option for creative individuals looking to earn money passively, as the platform takes care of all the sales, licensing, and payment processing.\n\nTo succeed in stock photography, focus on high-quality, in-demand images and videos. Popular subjects include business, travel, nature, and lifestyle. Over time, as you build up a portfolio, you can continue earning income from your existing work.\n\n7. Rent Out Your Space\n\nWhile this method involves more physical effort than some of the others, it is still a passive income stream that can be facilitated online. Websites like Airbnb and Vrbo allow homeowners and renters to rent out spare rooms, entire homes, or even unique properties like treehouses or cabins.\n\nOnce you've set up your listing on these platforms, guests can book your space, and you\u2019ll earn money for each stay. Depending on the demand in your area, this can be a significant source of passive income. If you don\u2019t want to personally manage bookings, you can also hire property management services to handle everything for you.\n\nWhile renting out your space may require some initial effort to get your property ready for guests, once the listings are live and guests are booking, the income can become largely passive.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn America, there are numerous ways to make money passively online, ranging from affiliate marketing and blogging to investing in stocks and creating digital products like courses and e-books. The key to success in earning passive income is to focus on strategies that align with your interests, expertise, and available time.\n\nWhile all of these methods require initial effort and setup, once the income streams are established, they can generate money with minimal maintenance. However, it\u2019s important to approach passive income with patience and perseverance. Building a passive income stream may take time, but with dedication and the right strategy, it can provide financial freedom and stability.\n\nWith the right tools, resources, and mindset, anyone can tap into the world of online passive income. Whether you are looking for a side hustle or a full-time career, the internet is a powerful platform that can help you achieve your financial goals.\n\n",

            "description": "I found a name for my real estate marketing business. We have decent startup capital, and our team is a software engineer that has worked on successful startups, a former corporate biglaw attorney, and a successful local real estate broker. \n\nThe name that we identified (1) perfectly describes the work we do; (2) is catchy; (3) works wonderfully for marketing materials because it\u2019s easy to use as a play-on-words. \n\nThe problem is that there\u2019s a company with our name already, in Florida, doing similar work (I\u2019m in Texas). They are doing it on a much smaller scale, not very intelligently, and seemingly with very little capital based on my review of their website and Facebook (they aren\u2019t anywhere else). \n\nIt\u2019s killing me that my team and I can\u2019t take advantage of the name because some random dude in Florida is using it but not doing much with it. \n\nI know the obvious answer is to change my name\u2014but it\u2019s hard to give up (like Musk and the letter X).\n\nI\u2019m considering starting up with the name anyway, doing what we can to take over the search engine results, and crossing the bridge in the future should we choose to operate in Florida (our business model depends on a network of connections). Does anyone have thoughts on the pros and cons?\n\nIn the short term I\u2019m worried about the two websites with the same name appearing in Google results. In the long term I\u2019m worried about legal action. \n\nI did some research into common law name usage and it seems pretty clear that a trademark can\u2019t defeat prior usage (correct me if I\u2019m wrong).",

The two majority owners had a falling out and aren't speaking. They both put more time and money in than I did but they have both been less than forthcoming with any details. What questions should I be asking? They have equipment to sell and have already begun liquidating assets. I'm honestly unsure if there is anything left and if it's worthwhile to contact a lawyer or just write it off. My $10,000 investment got me a 2% stake...  I can't imagine they even have $50k worth of stuff to sell based on the saturated market with the number of local breweries that have closed recently. So yeah, what should I be asking these guys? Friendships aside. \n\nThanks!\nThought I was a good friend, apparently an ignorant investor instead!\n\n",

We've always been a small company, but we have been adding more commercial contracts which is our main income. \nSince we took over the business from the previous owner, we have added 30 contracts with over 60 buildings to service. We feel incredibly blessed to have this much work - but we are so burnt out. We start our days at 7am and don't come home until 6-7pm sometimes later every day. We have tried hiring employees, but they all have quit to \"go find greener pastures\". It's so tiring putting in over a year of training, classes, and pouring my knowledge into someone just for them to quit and quit without notice usually putting us in a bind. This has happened 3 times now. I know owning a business is hard, but here lately it has been extremely hard. \nWe're exhausted. \nWe NEED employees who want to work and won't leave us hanging. Before people jump in and say you're not paying enough or maybe they're tired of being treated bad... it's very competitive pay for an apprenticeship - way more than I received in my apprenticeship. We gave them a holiday bonus, treated them and their families to a nice dinner as a thank you, pay commission on top of hourly, holidays off and paid, no weekends, and we pay for all licensing and training. I feel like we have been maybe a little too nice? But I never wanted to be that boss who is always griping at something and someone or not paying a livable wage. Everyone we have hired were kids (18-22) and decided to give them a chance because they seemed to want to join a trade and seemed really interested. I know being a locksmith is not at the top of someone's career choice but it's an honest trade. One made it a year and a half and became a diesel mechanic, one made it a little over a year and got frustrated and left a job site unfinished and quit, the other one decided to apply to nursing school and quit same day because they got in. \nI'm finding it really hard to keep my head above the water lately. I've been doing my best to balance everything but I feel like I'm falling behind more each day. \nUgh. A vacation sounds amazing at this point. \nIf you've made it this far thanks for listening. \n- One stressed out owner ",

I found out because a developer told me accidentally, I confronted him and he said he did not mean to hide it from me it just didn't come out)\n\nAnyways, fast forward to now, he is saying he would like to become partner and COO, and he would like to become a contributing partner for 40% of the company.\n\nI should add that he mentioned that, since he knows I lost quite a lot of money on this, I first should recoup my investment and make some money, and then become partner with him.\n\nHe just would like to make sure we sign sooner rather than later, to avoid the company becoming very profitable and me deciding not to later on, after he put a bunch of effort in.\n\nNote that the company is barely profitable now, netting around 5k a month for the first time.\n\nI personally feel like 40% is too much, and I have so many doubts, but I definitely recognize he is a valuable person in the company.\n\nOn the other side, he is involved with quite a few businesses, so he probably won't have nearly as much time as me to put in.\n\nOkay so, finally, these are my doubts:\n\nFirst of all, does he expect me to \"gift\" the partnership to him or is he going to pay for it?\n\nSecond of all, what percentage would be appropriate?\n\nThird question: should I even give him a percentage? Is there anything I should know before committting, and am I making a mistake?\n\nThe worst thing is that I feel like my judgement is impaired by how agreeable and shy I am, and so I don't know how to make an objective decision.\n\nThanks!",

            "description": "Apologies for the length of this post, but there\u2019s a lot to explain.\n\nI\u2019m an 18-year-old business owner in web design and digital marketing. I met a guy in the IT space at a trade show, and we hit it off. He became a mentor and friend and taught me how to communicate in this niche.\n\nHe brought me web design clients, and my team built the sites. I\u2019d get paid as he collected payments\u2014until things went sideways. A dispute with a client (not his fault) led to multiple clients dropping him, which meant I stopped getting paid. When that happened, he lost about $80K in monthly revenue, which was a major chunk of his business.\n\nAt that point, he owed me $50K+ but had only paid $6K. The remaining sites were generating $2,600/month, but he stopped paying, saying he needed the money elsewhere. I had sympathy for him since the whistleblower\u2019s claims were completely false, which I verified independently (not through anything he told or showed me). So, I let him miss a few months of payments so he could continue servicing his current clients and focus on sales, which I thought would get me paid sooner.\n\nEarly on, I had some red flags about him\u2014his demeanor, the way he carried himself, and the way he talked about money. He claimed to have sold his last company for millions, but when I looked him up, I found nothing concerning at the time. In fact, I was able to verify that he was the CEO of a successful IT company that did indeed sell, and it looked like he had done well for himself. That put my mind at ease\u2014until now.\n\nLooking back, I realize he groomed me into thinking he was someone he wasn\u2019t. He positioned himself as a successful entrepreneur and mentor, took a personal interest in my growth, and made me believe he had my best interests in mind. In reality, he was just setting up a situation where I trusted him enough to let my guard down.\n\nNow we\u2019re here, with a call on Friday, and I just Googled him again.\n\nTurns out he was indicted last month for wire fraud, money laundering, and bankruptcy fraud related to his old company. He never mentioned this and doesn\u2019t know I know. Now, I\u2019m concerned he\u2019ll just file bankruptcy, and I\u2019ll be left with nothing.\n\nOn Monday, he agreed to sign a personal guarantee, so depending on how the bankruptcy debt repayment process plays out, I could get a small amount back. But realistically, my priority is getting the web contracts.\n\nI\u2019ve come to the understanding that I won\u2019t be seeing the $55K, so I\u2019ve put together a deal that would at least allow me to recover my losses. Given where this situation stands, I\u2019ll do whatever I need to do to get those contracts\u2014that\u2019s the castle, and the money is just the pawns.\n\nMy plan is to reduce the amount from $55K and first present $25K, hoping to land around $10K\u2013$15K with a personal guarantee, while also taking over the web contracts ($2,600/month) to recover my losses over time.\n\nI feel embarrassed that I was taken advantage of and that I trusted him despite all the red flags. But I\u2019ve learned a valuable lesson and won\u2019t make these mistakes again.\n\nDoes this seem like the right deal to bring to the table, or should I approach it differently? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the great advise, I really appreciate it. If you have any leads on a lawyer in Colorado please DM me. ",

            "description": "This is an update to my original post on r/smallbusiness on 1/30/2025.\n\nTLDR: I confronted him about the indictment, and he responded with manipulation, threats, and removing my access to the websites I built. My lawyer confirmed I\u2019m not committing slander or libel by reaching out to affected clients, and I\u2019ve now learned he was charging people\u2019s credit cards without authorization. A lawsuit doesn\u2019t make sense for me, but I\u2019m now dealing with his lawyer instead of him. I haven\u2019t reached out to his clients yet, as I want to see what offer he comes back with first. Open to advice on my next move.\n\nFull Update:\n\nFirst off, thank you all for the advice and the reality check on this guy. I definitely needed it. I\u2019ve reached out to multiple lawyers, and while I have options, none of them are particularly great. I\u2019m also fully aware that I will likely be seeing no money from this, or if I\u2019m lucky, maybe a few thousand dollars. At this point, my focus is on either getting some money or bringing this guy down.\n\nI met with a lawyer last Thursday before the scheduled call to go over my options. He advised me to present two choices: either pay the outstanding balance in full or transfer the web contracts over to me. On the call, I started by confronting him about the fact that I was aware of his indictment. His response? \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d\n\nShortly after, I noticed that he removed all my access to the websites I built. Following my lawyer\u2019s advice, I sent him this message:\n\n\t\u201cSince you removed my access to these websites, I have to tell these clients that I am no longer responsible for their websites or anything that happens to them. I also have to tell them why our partnership ended. If we can\u2019t work out our differences, I will have to tell your employee (who is the backbone of his business) why we are not working together anymore, and he will figure out the reason.\u201d\n\nThis was my attempt to lay down all my cards and push him to sign over the contracts before his entire business collapsed. His response?\n\n- He accused me of being \u201cdisappointing\u201d after all he had \u201cdone for me\u201d (classic manipulation).\n- He said, \u201cYou can settle on a financial payback arrangement, and that will complete our relationship and my financial obligations.\u201d\n- He also threw in some threats: \u201cI\u2019m protecting the websites and their information. Furthermore, slander and libel will get you no money. I\u2019ve already sent this to my lawyer to draw up an agreement. If you go further, you get nothing.\u201d\n\nFor the record, my lawyer confirmed that nothing I said was slander or libel\u2014I\u2019m simply protecting my business by reaching out to people who were affected.\n\nAt this point, I also reached back out to some old clients I had been connected with to ask why they really stopped working with him. That\u2019s when I found out that he was charging their credit cards without authorization and generating fake invoices\u2014exactly what he\u2019s under indictment for elsewhere.\n\nGiven that he will likely be in jail within the next eight months and will have much higher debts to deal with than what he owes me, a personal guarantee or financial payment plan is completely off the table. A lawsuit doesn\u2019t make sense for me either, because if he requests to take it to court, I\u2019d have to front a ton of money and time\u2014neither of which are worth it at this moment.\n\nThe one upside? My lawyer is happy that we\u2019ll now be dealing with his lawyer, who will have far more common sense than this guy.\n\nFor whatever reason, I feel like getting advice from Reddit is a really great second perspective compared to just relying on a lawyer, who ultimately would prefer to see this go to court. I\u2019ve noticed that some legal advice I\u2019ve received (but haven\u2019t taken) could have easily gotten me sued even if I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, so I\u2019m trying to be as careful as possible. Right now, I haven\u2019t reached out to his clients yet, as I want to see what offer he comes back with first. If anyone has thoughts on where to go from here, let me know. Thank you all!",

            "description": "This is for my father in law.  I found out this Xmas he has gotten himself in a huge mess.  He took out a SBA loan of 200K for his small dump truck business.  Apparently he\u2019s been using up that money anytime he couldn\u2019t make ends meet.  Clearly the business is not viable for them to live.  He clears about 20-30K a year and any small period of no work just breaks him.  I only found out about this because he finally ran out of money and now needs people to bail him out.   He ran through $200K and does not have a very healthy business to show for it.  \n\nSo now what?   What are his options realistically with this loan?   He\u2019s 65 years old.  There\u2019s no way he\u2019s realistically paying this thing off.  But apparently it\u2019s an unforgivable loan. Not sure what that really means.  I\u2019ve seen he can apply for forgiveness but seems like he likely won\u2019t qualify for that.  Fact is there is zero chance he\u2019s paying that off.  The dump truck has a lien so do they just repossess that and call if done?   Or will they garner his social security once that kicks in??\n\nPlease help. This man has made an absolute mess of things and I\u2019m gonna end up being the one to have to cover him and need to make sure I fully understand the risks to me and my household.  At the very least he can declare bankruptcy and get rid of this truck but then I\u2019m basically taking care of him.   Need to know what his options are so I\u2019m understand the true cost and risk to me.  \n\n\nEdit 2/2:\n\nThank you for all the responses.  I now know some questions to ask and what direction to head.  \n\nCouple of answers.\nOne truck.  He clears maybe 80-100K a year but from the looks of it at 100K he\u2019s brining home around 20-25K.  He needs 120K to make it work.  Even then I don\u2019t see him paying 200K off with that structure. This year he\u2019s closer to 65-70K which with want it costs to run he\u2019s in the red.  That\u2019s mostly due to the fact the $1000 a month loan payment has now gone into effect.  He had a grace period of a few years where he didn\u2019t have to make any payments.  It is an Eidl loan.  I\u2019m asked him for the paparwork so we can get the details and terms.  \n\nSome have wondered how this could legally come back on me.  I don\u2019t think it will or can. I meant risk more in the sense that if the man can\u2019t work there is a risk to my finances since I\u2019ll likely have to take care of him.  Even if he declares bankruptcy and gets out of this he\u2019s moving in with us.  Which\u2026that ain\u2019t happening!  Well if I can help it.  \n\nI\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m trying to work out if he can work at this for a few more years and pay minimums on everything (so much debt!) and just you know live but then what\u2019s our plan when he physically can\u2019t work anymore.  He for sure ain\u2019t paying the big loan off but maybe he just drags it out for a few years, stocks some cash away, and then declares bankruptcy once he\u2019s eligible for social security.  Then we work from there.  Or\u2026 we close shop now and I bridge him till social security hits and he finds a more stable income.  Which will be what?  For a 65 yo with little to no skills.  Flipping furniture. Ha. ",

I suddenly feel exhausted and want to get to that stage sooner rather than later.\nI am sure every business is different and we all have different capacities and the things that exhaust us. Having said that, based on the response of the earlier posts, it seems a lot of you guys feel the same as me. Can those that have already established their businesses beyond the grind enlighten us on what you did to get there?\n",

I made a small amount from it, about $20,000 gross income.\n\nFor more context, I live in Texas, and that year I had no other sources of income. All payments are recorded through Squarespace / Stripe, so I have records of my income.\n\n  \nHowever, since this is my rodeo with self-employment, I had zero idea that taxes were to be paid quarterly. I have some money saved for taxes, but I just didn't know they were to be paid throughout the year. Kinda stupid of me, I know, but I have a pretty bad understanding of how taxes work in self-employment :/\n\n\n\nSo I actually have a few questions:\n\nWhat do I do now? Do I just pay all the taxes I owe right now? Or by April 15? I heard there's a penalty for missing quarterly payments and it accrues. Am I screwed?\n\nI also created a sole proprietor LLC (my friend recommended me to for liability issues) in December 2024. Do I file taxes any differently this year? Can I still FreeTaxUSA this or do I go a different route?\n\nAlso, for the money I made this year - how do I pay the taxes for it? I know the deadlines, but how would I go about estimating and paying the taxes for the income I made so far this fiscal year?\n\n\n\nThanks!!",

We've only gone back 6 months so far and it's about $1000-$2000 extra each month he's skimming off the top. I know that doesn't sound like much but we're a small restaurant and narrow profit margins.

It wasent the best cars but it got me into working with them. \n\nI live in sweden and choose to go transportation/truck driving as my education because everyone else did and the people that got in to mechanics didnt need good grades so always thought it would be better. I now realise it choose wrong.\n\nIm finishing school this summer but recently found a garage for sale which i rented instantly because of the great price.\n\nBefore this i worked outside my house on the asphalt road and my dad got me a 180 peice toolbox which had all the basic necessities. After 3 years of working on my car and my friends cars i tested my self and looked for a v70 to buy cheap and broken.\n\nBought the v70 for 600 Dollars and 14 days later it was sold for 2600 dollars the repair cost of the car was 60 euros including washing, polish, vacuum lines, and the main problem a car mechanic shop couldent solve ( injectors that costed me 5 dollars). \n\nFelt really proud from the win on that car and a few weeks later bought the garage. Im currently rebuilding my first engine because i drove my daily way to hard. ( have 5 bolts left on the engine). Sure it really isnt worth the time and money to rebuild it, but the experince and stuff i learn from doing it is.\n\nIve during the same time bought a saab 9-3 v6 stage 1 tuned from a coworker i hade during work practice as a truckdriver. Fixed it in two weeks and am going to sell it for 3800 bought it for 1600. \n\nBuying a caddilac this week for 7500 dollars from some customer i meet during work practice. My plan is to sell it for 25k dollars and find another garage since i got about 3 months until i need to move out because someone bought the garage.\n\nDuring all this time ive meet new people that have alot of experience and are good mechanics became friends with them even though they are 20 years older than me. And told them about my future plans of opening a used car dealership and eventually going into real estate.\n\nMy dad works with economics for 99%of the car companies in my small town so i get to hear what they do and ive realised from my mechanic friends that worked on them that they all are either inexperienced with working on cars, avoid taxes, and do alot shady work. \n\nOne of these mechanic friends i got havent been paid for 6 months because the owner does folkrace and dosent know how to manage his economy. The guy works his ass of and works more then he is allowed while the owner does jack shit. The company just filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMy mechanic friend asked me about my future plans about cars and in general, i responed that i want to buy and repair, restore, wash and sell the cars. Pretty much the entire chain of the car buissnes. I explained that i would out compete all the other dealerships because i want to keep everything very organised legal, and treat the cars like they where mine. Also told him that i wouldnt register as a company since alot of people are smart and know companies charge a premium. I will still declare taxes making it legal to sell as many cars as i want. And that the people that work for me wouldent get hourly paid or a permanent paycheck but instead they get a certain % of the profit depending on how consistently, fast, and good they work on cars.\n\nWhich basiclly means the more money they make me the more money they make. The guy said i will work for you as soon as it gets running and 2 other people. \n\nThe big problem is expanding the buissness because there really arent alot of mechanics that are very intressted by the work they do and alot of them are sloppy and disorganised(tools everywhere).\n\nI belive i will completely break the other companies to the ground. With the quality of service and non shady work. Especially since ive made a bunch of great contacts to have in the car game, i cant optimize cars for free, work on them efficiently, im a good salesmen for cars, i know what cars are worth the time and which ones are not. \n\nIm doing all this on my freetime after my 07.00-16.00 practice and school. \n\nIve matured way faster than my age group and i am intelligent. I know im intelligent because my sister is a psychologist and did a intelligence test when i was younger and recently which showed i was more intelligent than average. \n\nDoes anyone have similar experinces or think this will workout or have a similar buissness. Please give any tips on what i could be doing to make more money in this buissnes.\n\nFyi i reinvest all the money i get into tools that i need or use often to lower the time it takes from buying to selling a car. \n\nRegards, 18yo trying to make it in life.",

            "description": "I inherited about 34 rundown properties when I got out of college. At 22, I moved to where they were located and taught myself how to repair homes and run a rental business. Over the years, I sold four and gradually renovated 24 of them to make them livable and income-producing. The homes are fully paid off, but since they\u2019re in a rural area, I can\u2019t charge high rents like in bigger cities. I clear about $45K a year, and my only major expenses are my mortgage and personal costs.\n\nThe challenge is that it's hard to increase my income given the rental market here. My family lives 100 miles away, so I can only physically manage the properties two days a week. Before, it was a full-time, 50-hour-a-week job handling repairs and tenants. Fortunately, the work I put in over the past 10 years allowed me to take three months off when my child was born and now only spend two days a week in the city where my rentals are. I manage everything else remotely.\n\nI\u2019m 33 and currently have $100K in a Roth IRA and another $120K in a taxable brokerage account. Now that I have a child, I need to produce more income, but I don\u2019t want to jack up rents on the tenants I\u2019ve built relationships with over the years. My current strategy is to raise rent when tenants move out, but that\u2019s a slow process. I\u2019m grateful for this business, but I worry that the distance will become increasingly challenging over time.\n\nRight now, when vacancies happen, it takes me months to get a house rented again because I can\u2019t be on-site to oversee progress and manage contractors efficiently. I also want to buy another home for my family next year, but that would require a significant chunk of my savings\u2014unless I can strategically leverage my current assets to make the purchase. Since the rentals are fully paid off, I\u2019m wondering what the best move is going forward.\n\n",

We\u2019re incredibly proud of our business and offerings to our customers and we always go the extra mile for customer satisfaction.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve had 1 customer who decided to cancel an order with no notice, which was custom made to his specifications and was just about to be ready for collection and upon wanting to be refunded, we said he would be subject to a cancellation fee. Reasonable given we had spent over $1400 for a custom made product. In any event, he got physically violent and abusive (we\u2019ve never navigated a situation like this before). We decided to cut our losses and refund him in full, it genuinely wasn\u2019t worth the hassle.\n\nA week or so later, he and literally heaps of fake accounts attributed to him, his sister and his wife all left horribly nasty Google reviews about our business. We\u2019ve only ever had 1 negative review and nearly 100 5 star reviews - it has dropped our score down from 4.9 Stars to 4.3 Stars. It doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal, but it\u2019s genuinely unfair as he did it to be spiteful. He\u2019s also said if we paid him an extra $500 he *might* remove them. \n\nAny ideas to get them taken down? We\u2019ve reported to Google but nothing. We\u2019ve tried to bury them under heaps of new genuine reviews, but our score has climbed slowly and it has definitely impacted sales. ",

            "title": "Am I crazy to think about taking the leap?",
            "description": "Let me start by saying that I have been dreaming about being a full time entrepreneur ever since I started my business. I started up a little less than 3.5 years ago, and it has really started to take off this last year. \n\nTotal Sales Numbers by Year: \n\n- 2021 (Oct-Dec): $1,243.85\n- 2022: $13,884.08 (+1,000%)\n- 2023: $23,315.99 (+68%)\n- 2024: $181,774.29 (+680%)\n- 2025 (YTD): $21,369.96 (+134% YoY)\n\nFor reference, my business is a niche e-commerce business. We operate with ~70% margin on our unit economics and the business is currently run entirely out of my garage with low overhead. As you can see from our sales numbers, we\u2019ve really started to gain traction over the last year or so. We launched with one product in 2021, launched a second product at the end of 2023, and launched additional variants of that second product in 2024, just before the holidays. We are working on designs/financing for 2 more frequently requested products in 2025 with the hope of launching them by October so we can take full advantage of the sales spike we get around that time.\n\nMy income with my full time job is $74,500. In 2024, the business paid me an additional $28,000 that we threw almost entirely into debt (other than supplementing my wife\u2019s income for 3 months while she was out on maternity leave). My wife is an independent contractor who essentially works on commission. She works 3 days/week and earns somewhere around $80,000/year. (Hard to know the numbers exactly given the aforementioned maternity leave.) Her employer does not offer benefits. We pay $23,400/year for childcare for our two children. Our health insurance, benefits, etc. all run through my current employer. \n\nI really believe in my ability to grow the business over the next year if I were to take the leap and go out on my own, but I\u2019m nervous about it as the head of household. I don\u2019t want to put my family in a difficult financial position. \n\nWith my wife working three days/week, our plan would be for me to watch the kids those three days, working on the business during naps/as I\u2019m able (packing and shipping orders, etc.), and focus more on the business Friday-Monday. which would eliminate our $23,400 daycare expense and lower the amount I would need to pay myself. \n\nThe goal is that, by me jumping into the business 4+ days/week, I\u2019m able to grow it even faster than it has grown while I\u2019ve been working on it in my spare time. There is a lot of potential for bulk orders in our business that I would focus on initially to drive an increase in sales. Eventually, our hope is that my wife can stay home full time with our kids and our whole family can be supported by the business. I see this as a safer stair step in that direction.\n\nCurrently, my biggest concerns are related to A. The cost of health insurance in the marketplace ($1,000+/month for my family of 4 vs ~$130/month through my employer) and B. My ability to continue to receive financing from my bank to fund inventory when I no longer have a \u201creal\u201d job. (Planning a conversation with them later this week about this very topic, any advice in this department would be welcomed.) \n\nLooking for insight from those of you who have taken the leap. What did it take for you to take the plunge? Do you think that the plan I\u2019ve laid out above sounds reasonable? Do I do it? ",

            "description": "Hello,\n\nI am a 26 year old refrigeration technician with 8 years experience and have previously run my own small company in refrigeration but this isn't something i want to do for my whole life..\n\nAs i have a very entrepreneurial spirit and mindset about life i've been thinking of many ways over the years i can out of the day to day of dealing with shit clients and their shit work and make something more of myself.\n\nSo i bring you my idea i would love some feedback on:\n\nSince refrigeration is my passion i would like to design and create something no one has ever seen before, i would like to build and manufacture small self contained units that can be installed under any surface such as, coffee tables, kitchen benches, dining tables, computer desks, poker tables etc the list goes on.\n\nThis unit will be about 500mm squared, how it will work is you will need to cut a 400mm circle with a plunge router onto the surface you would like it and keep the cut out section, then the unit will be installed lining up with the hole cut-out and the piece will be reinstalled back into place with a nice stainless circular trim to cover any visible gap. From this point all that will need to happen is a button installation and to be plugged into the powerpoint.\n\nThen you will have a rising refrigerated compartment that will lift up from the table were drinks or food can be placed and for it to drop back down seamlessly back into the surface it had been installed in. one step further i was thinking of creating a new business that will build and construct these into epoxy coffee tables, desks and other furniture items.\n\nMy first integration of this unit will be in a beautiful epoxy resin top coffee table, thinking of also adding in JBL hidden speakers, fingerprint lockable draw, wireless charging pad etc, but these are just ideas for the coffee table the main show will be the lifting refrigerated compartment\n\nPlease feel free to give me feedback if this is something you would want to buy???\n\nWhat would you realistically pay for something like this??\n\nEpoxy resin tables go from 2k -5k plus this design no one's seen before, i was thinking the baseline model starting from 3.5k roughly, what do you guys think?\n\nIf just a standard table top can be much much cheaper, or should i sell the unit for the client to install themself?",

            "description": "My  goal is start a successful business by the age of 40. I know I might be a little late. I guess better late than never. \n\nBy successful I mean a decent income or revenue 100k a year would be nice, maybe 1 or 2 employees, and a potential for growth. My end goal is to have some sort of income down the road that will be beneficial to kids. \n\nCurrent status: I am a little all over the place. I have about three different things going and I don't know if they are going to work or if the time and effort is really beneficial.\n\nBusiness idea 1 (currently in motion) - IT related business, repair computers, provide tech support, networking, hardware, software, basic IT trouble shooting. I have already started this and have 2-3 small clients probably made about 3k profit in a 6-8 month period while working a full time and helping out with the family. I have a background in IT (minimal related tech support) and have a good skill to land clients. Seems to pretty good at finding potential customers. I just don't know if this business is really worth it in 2025....I guess the business would have to obviously expand to cover all things IT related, networking, etc to really grow. \n\n  \nBusiness Idea 2 (sort of in motion) - Private investigator / process server / general investigative work for lawyers, individuals, and other business. This is a a passion of mine as I work for a larger company doing similar work and have a good set of skills for this type of work. Prior law enforcement and other skills have helped me. I have only really generated 1 client...maybe 500$ profit I just don't see this really generating a ton of profit down the road. It's kind of a small niche unless you really stick your neck out and do insurance related work etc. I like this business idea and think I could easily grow it just not sure it would be to the scale that I want.\n\n  \nBusiness Idea 3 - Rental property, buy a rental property and go up from there. It seems that my research shows this possibly being most profitable or \"good investment\".....I just have NO experience in this. No idea what the hell to do or where to even start. I do have a good bit of savings to potentially put a nice down payment on a house but is it worth it with tenants destroying everything etc. Really not sure what to do here.\n\n  \nBusiness idea 4 - I told yall I was all over the place - Car dealership. Small car dealership. Selling cars, etc. I love cars, love selling things online, have a passion for advertising and marketing. My wife says I can sell pretty much anything quickly. This seems to be an easy startup with really only needed a physical location and from what I have read don't even need that. (loop holes) etc. I just have have minimal mechanical skills and buying a car from an auction could lead to high cost for repairs and not much profit at the end of the day. Also seem to be a good bit of small dealerships in my area.\n\n  \nJust need someone to give me some strong feedback...I'm ok with all feedback positive or negative. I just think I have my eggs spread all over and need them in one basket haha. Making this post is also kind of venting for my current situation in life.",

I am a dreamer, I know this. I have way too many ideas and not enough money in the bank to keep up. That being said.. Google just keeps pointing me to sba 504 loans but Im not sure if that's the correct route I would take or what. Do I need two separate loans since they are zoned differently?

I recently left my first company, and started working for the biggest company in my town. The pay is a little better but I just don\u2019t like it. This company is alot more strict than my last company, and the amount of micromanaging is crazy. Can\u2019t stand the managers either. My current company has beef with my previous companies owner (who I am still cool with) and I recently was caught in the crossfire of the drama between them.  I honestly can\u2019t stand it here. At first, I thought I was beginning to get burnt out, but i\u2019m starting to realize, I just can\u2019t stand having to report to people, and having people tell me what to do or dealing with their drama.\n\nI want to start my own business. Nothing crazy, just me and a truck. Idk why, but it sounds damn near impossible for someone my age to venture off and start their own thing, especially in 2025. Maybe its just me being discouraged and anxious. Idk, I just want my own thing so I don\u2019t have to deal with anybody. Can\u2019t stand being an employee, risking my life on the side of the road just for a percentage of money. Obviously being an owner is a whole different type of headache, but i\u2019m willing to start, I just don\u2019t know how and where to begin. Any advice? Thanks  ",

That would be $200 per bartender, and that is also considering the time to set up and break down, brining our own equipment, and commute. I figured this would be a decent price. They would provide all the alcohol and would have a couple of specialty drinks on the menu, beer and wine. \n\nAfter I sent the price, they said they only have a budget of $300 for bartenders. They said this is because they would have to provide the tables to bartend on. Isn\u2019t this something they would have to provide anyways to any private bartender? Also, they are justifying the 300$ by having tip jars placed out and are claiming the party guests will bring good tips.

            "description": "I run a small company in the mental health field. Our products are therapy, coaching, and access to some course content (videos, self-help workbooks, etc). So far it\u2019s been just me, and it\u2019s been very profitable and successful. I\u2019m expanding my product offering significantly. Right now, my marketing\u00a0 budget is about $1,000 for SEO and $2,000 for Google Ads. have an SEO consultant I\u2019m paying. I also have a Google Ads consultant, but I\u2019m not including him in this analysis because I don\u2019t see his role changing. The Google Ads I\u2019m running myself. I have good personal experience in Google Ads from a previous business. The Google Ads have a good price per lead: about $200 per lead which equates to $600 per client/sale and about 10 leads a month. The SEO is also generating about 10 leads a month and has slowly ramped up over the past two years since I\u2019ve been doing SEO.\u00a0 So currently in total I spend $3,000 for 20 leads or $150 per lead.\n\nI\u2019ve got about $50,000 earmarked for marketing spend to spend over four months as I launch my new expansion. That $50K includes both \u201cone time\u201d investment (consultants, strategy, website work, etc) and recurring monthly costs during this implementation phase. This marketing spend will be invested over a period of four months. By the end of the four months, I\u2019d like to be at a steady state with double the amount of leads from previously, ie about 40 leads per month. I\u2019m willing to double the cost I\u2019ll allow for a lead up to $300 per lead. \u00a0\n\nMore context, I have a valuable email list of about 1,000 emails of past leads or contacts that filled out information forms. I tried a couple email blasts but got a very poor open rate and gave up. Peer to peer therapist marketing is not a bad strategy (the other therapist might have a client they can refer), but I haven\u2019t tried much. I have over 10 hours of content that I could have someone pick apart to push a reels/tiktok/youtube shorts campaign. I could also build a good youtube channel. I tried facebook marketing, but it wasn\u2019t profitable. I built my website myself. It\u2019s decent but not great. Part of my budget was going to be allocated to a website polish and strategist to help me with the pitch, landing page, product offering, etc. Of everything I\u2019ve tried, Google ads is most dependable but the more I spend, the less efficient it gets. I\u2019m not sure how much more I can go.\u00a0\n\nHow would you spend the $50,000 budget? I\u2019m thinking about 2/3 of that will be in \u201cinvestment/experimentation\u201d and 1/3 of that will be in recurring monthly ppc/seo. \u00a0I\u2019m a DIY guy but I don\u2019t know if I have the time or expertise to optimize this process. Should I plan it myself or should I find a great consultant with experience in niche therapy/coaching/course content marketing and turn the strategy over?\n\nPlease help with your suggestions and feel free to DM me.",

Anything else we can help you with?\u201d Umm, no thanks.  \n\n\n\nFor context, I\u2019m in Los Angeles, so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s because of the wildfires or something? But still, doubling my premium with no explanation feels wild.  \n\n\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? What did you do? And more importantly, do you have an insurance company you actually like? I\u2019m looking for something reliable, easy to work with, and not gonna randomly jack up my rates.  \n\n\n\nAny tips or recommendations would be so appreciated. I\u2019m pretty clueless when it comes to insurance, so you guys are my lifeline right now. Thanks in advance, you rock!  \n\n",

I would love to cater my desserts to parties and such, and sell them to people in my school. I have almost every aspect planned except for a few problems I\u2019ve run into. \n\n1. School, two problems arise out of this. \nThe first one is that it takes away a lot of time, lets say someone wants to play an order at 12pm but I don\u2019t leave until 2:00 I\u2019m scared this will make me lose many customers it causes a huge dent. \nThe second problem is that I would love to advertise to people in my school but I\u2019m I grew up in America. My parents moved us to Jordan so I\u2019m new here and I don\u2019t fit in with the girls at all, I don\u2019t have friends in my classes and I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be able to advertise or give them business cards because of this . The girls here are very judgmental and I feel like I\u2019d get too nervous to give them my business card, I\u2019m thinking I could shoot them a message to follow me on instagram but I only have a couple of girls in my class added not most of them, does anyone have any advice on this?\n\n2. Delivery, I want to provide delivery but I don\u2019t drive and I know my mom wouldn\u2019t be up to being my delivery driver, and my dad has his own work. I was thinking maybe I could order and uber driver tell him to deliver the goods to the place of delivery and bring me back the money but I\u2019m not sure if this is a good idea because I\u2019m scared he\u2019ll take the money and run off with it.  Any better ideas?\n\nAnd if anyone has any extra advice please lmk!! I\u2019d love some advice on how to build up followers on instagram and facebook too! Thanks for reading ",

            "description": "So, basically I'm working on starting a new retail business utilizing 1/3 of the commercial property I own (separate entrance/signage from my current long standing business that operates in the other portion of the building.) \n\nThe partner I'm looking to take on is the general manager of my current business who has worked for me for 10/11 years I've been in business and currently runs the second location we opened in another city. Suffice to say, I'd like to recognize and reward him for being such an instrumental help in the growth of my current company as well as being a great friend of mine at this point.\n\nA little bit about the business that he and I have both worked on planning and setting up in the unused portion of the commercial property I own..  \n  \n\\-My current business corporation has paid for the renovation of the space and will also be footing the bill for the initial start up costs (80k-100K est.) for inventory, fixtures, signage, etc..  \n\\-Rent would be paid to my other separate corporation that owns the building, in keeping with the general $/sqft that we had previously been renting it for before the purchase of the building a year ago.  \n\\-I expect there will be a loan repayment from the new business back to my current business to pay back the initial costs before any profits are withdrawn for either party.  \n\n\nMy main question is how I should structure this company and at what ratio to ensure the smoothest day to day business possible. My initial thoughts are to form yet another new corporation as opposed to something like a general partnership. The next point is how to divide the shares, considering my current company will be footing all of the initial start up costs and my partners value is more in the initial planning and sweat equity past and future. I could be alright with 50/50 but am also thinking 70/30 in my favour may be more practical...certainly for the quick resolution of any future disagreements or disputes. I am of the belief there should a clear leader who has the final say on decisions when it comes to a stalemate.\n\nI do believe this new business has the potential to grow and expand alongside my current successful business. I would really like to accomplish both rewarding his many years of service with a part of this new business whilst also maintaining a practical and structured agreement/split to ensure as little road bumps as possible while it grows.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions.

They seem to all want me to stick to a fixed payment schedule. To be clear, the payment schedule would still remain, but if I as the customer pay off the bill say 7 days earlier, I won\u2019t be charged on the billing date, in this example, the 17th of the month.

We follow all the best practices around this, including displaying clear terms on our checkout page and sending reminder emails a week before a subscription is going to renew.

More often than not, this leads to a lot of emails back and forth wasting our time, followed by a chargeback of the transaction (which we often win, but only after wasting even more time on the paperwork).\n\nThe hardest part isn't the expense or the lost time. It's putting up with hostile, manipulative, lying clients (not all of them, but it happens a LOT). They yell at us, threaten to sue us and bad mouth us online, and harass us with calls and emails. And then they lie to their bank to say that the transaction wasn't authorized when in fact it was.\n\nMost of this falls on my lap because the more junior staff members don't know how to deal with situations like this, or don't want to.\n\nDoes anyone have any tricks to dealing with such clients without long drawn out arguments?",

I am starting to do projects for companies that involve some large deliveries of equipment which then need to arrive to the companies where I'm doing the work. (E.g. 35 pound box, 4 feet tall - not gigantic but a hassle to deal with on my own)\n\nGetting Amazon, Best Buy, etc, to reliably deliver to an office between only 9am-5pm, is a real PITA. Aside from the game of, maybe UPS keeps at a UPS store (then take a hand truck to the UPS store)  or maybe I get it to my place and take it to the site with an Uber....\n\nIs there a name for a service which can accept a delivery after hours, hold it in storage for up to a week, and reliably redeliver within a 1-2 hour as I request? If my business gets bigger I just am doing some research. I guess this is like a storage unit plus Uber delivery, but curious if the combined services are something that exists. I'm sure it's not cheap but just trying to know what it is. Thank you!",

Instead of wasting time on entrance exams I want to spend this year learning building and documenting my journey along the way.\n\nI\u2019m pretty good with people and recently did a 5-day in-office internship at a foundersoffice. I\u2019ve also been managing communities on Discord and WhatsApp, hosting virtual events, and working with a creator. I\u2019ve saved up \u20b946,360 from side hustles which should cover 2-3 months of living in any city.\n\nOn weekends, I\u2019ve been attending networking events, which gave me a lot of exposure to how the startup and VC space works. As a commerce student, I\u2019m really interested in this space and want to keep learning more while building something of my own.\n\nSo, I\u2019m looking for a co-working space that\u2019s either free or super affordable where I can focus on my work and document my progress. The whole idea is to learn and build as I go and maybe after a year of documenting this journey, an investor might get inspired to back me. I\u2019ve transformed a lot over the last 2-3 years but haven\u2019t really documented it yet, and now I want to.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know how to use Reddit properly, just got a suggestion from ChatGPT to try this so here I am.

(Idk if this makes sense)\n\nWe never intended to start a business but created a product that went viral and started selling them because other people were trying to rip off our design and sell it as their own. \n\nWe started a partnership LLC, registered our business with state and federal (got an EIN), and opened a sales tax account with the state. We also have a trade dress on our item. We have basically set all of this up on our own through the help of YouTube and information on the internet (minus the trade dress, we went to a lawyer).\n\nLast year we made around 10k of sales direct to consumer. This year we are on track to make a similar amount but with a different distribution ~8K coming from tax exempt wholesalers, and maybe 1-2k from direct sales. \n\nThe fad is over, but it's still relevant in our city so we get sporadic orders and I'm wondering if it's worth it to keep it all going, tax-wise. Last year when I did our taxes, I think it was like $2-300 to file our taxes because we made it complicated and did a partnership LLC. I do about 90% of the work so if we were to dissolve it it would be run through my taxes. Last year I accidentally did the taxes late (in early April), and we each got like a $500 fine and I'm worried about things like that happening and eating up our already small profit. \n\nLong story short I guess my question is can you still run a business after dissolving it? What are the tax implications of something like this? \n\nWe have an Etsy account in addition to our main website and I know sales and state taxes are automatically taken out for us, could that be a solution?\n\n\n\n",

I've been trying to get a feel for how much merchants who are part of this might get. Does anyone know how it might be calculated?  Only thing I've found so far is -\n\n  \nThis settlement operates on a fixed fund basis. We anticipate the total value of claims to surpass the settlement fund, so all submissions could be proportionally reduced. This means those submitting claims will receive a fraction of their estimated interchange fee volume during the settlement period. Currently, there\u2019s no way to accurately project how much money you could get back.\n\nAs an example, if the total settlement fund amounts to $5 billion and valid claims sum up to $125 billion, the payout will represent a proportional share for each $1.00 claimed. In this scenario, with $125 billion in claims against a $5 billion fund, each claimant would receive a gross payout of $0.04 for every $1.00 of valid claims made.\n\n\\-  \nMy company paid about $150K in merchant fees over a few years.

            "description": "Hey everyone! So today I received an email from a company called Global Recognition Awards stating that I\u2019ve won and am entitled to various advertising options (and some free graphics to post on social media). I know there\u2019s thousands of these companies that mean absolutely nothing and take advantage of start ups so I\u2019ve been reading everything I can find about the company for the last few hours. \n\nThere are several articles from publications like Forbes that mention them, as well as some independent-looking reviews on forums like here and Quora. It seems relatively legit, but is something like this worth it? \nI understand that their end game is to sell you an advertising package, but I\u2019m not entirely opposed to that if it drums up interest. \n\nSince I can\u2019t post screenshots I\u2019ll list a few quotes and where they came from. \n\nFrom the email- Rent a Toyota Arapahoe has been recognized with a 2025 Global Recognition Award for its exceptional service, commitment to providing top-quality rental vehicles, and dedication to supporting local communities. Located in Centennial, Colorado, this Toyota dealership has transformed the rental car industry by offering a unique blend of affordability, flexibility, and customer-centric initiatives. The dealership's inventive approach sets it apart from traditional rental car companies, making it an attractive choice for many customers. A panel of impartial industry experts evaluated you using the Rasch model. This model creates a linear measurement scale for each applicant regardless of their category or field of expertise. Winning a Global Recognition Award is entirely free; however, we do have some upgrades starting that you might like to consider.\n\nFrom Forbes- The 2023 metrics highlight the rising influence of the Global Recognition Awards. Celebrating its 450th award showcases its growing prominence among numerous startup award competitions. This achievement, recognized earlier in the year, reflects GRA's growth, increased trust, and an impressive 300% surge in business applications to the program. This year stands out as the competition\u2019s most robust, even amidst global challenges. As Sparks proudly states, the Global Recognition Awards is more than an accolade; it catalyzes startup growth and unmatched visibility. The bond between recognition and growth is evident as startups under GRA's umbrella see a boost in their market presence and credibility. Moreover, the networking opportunities and exposure GRA offers are second to none. Winning startups not only gain recognition but also join a dynamic community of innovators, industry leaders, and potential investors. This comprehensive approach to supporting startups uniquely places GRA in a competitive landscape of business awards.\n\nAI generated summary of Business Insider articles- \t\tBusiness Insider highlights various recipients of the 2024 Global Recognition Award for notable achievements.\n* \t\tRecent articles showcase winners in fields like artificial intelligence, e-commerce, and advertising.\n* \t\tThe Global Recognition Awards celebrate exceptional contributions by individuals and organizations worldwide.\n\nThe URL for their website is right around 2 years old, so newer but not enough to raise a huge red flag. \n\nThoughts?

Money is spending like crazy, getting 3 calls a day from some campaigns, 7 on another one in a different area(this one perform the best), and some other locations i have days with 0-1 leads a day.  \nQuality score is kinda fine (some are with 8 whille some with 5). Impression share lost is 70% in some cases and some other with 50%. I need more volume and can't figure out how. I stopped working with my google ads manager cause i'm tired from paying him and google and making almost no money.  \nI'm tired of getting people on Fiveer and Upwork who claim to be an expert but in the end wasting your time and money. They're fine with getting a chance for 2-3 months and then get fired, i'm not.  \nWhere can i find some real google ads experts? (not looking for an agency since i don't want to be just another client plus they're charging crazy amount of money which in my opinion doesn't make sense.",

If I open a **U.S. LLC as a non-resident**, will I need to pay any U.S. taxes, or does it remain tax-free as long as I have no U.S. clients/employees?\n\n2. Since I\u2019ll be running operations from Hong Kong, would all my income still be considered Hong Kong-sourced and taxed accordingly?\n\n3. Is this structure even worth it for the **perceived value of having a U.S. LLC**, or should I just keep things local in HK?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who\u2019s done something similar or has insights into the tax side of things.  \n  \nThanks in advance!",

What traits to look out for (good and bad)? \n\nI have had some really good and really bad employees. It's hard for me to point to any common threads among them but hiring is always kind of a crap shoot. A few things I look for now are that employees stay with jobs for at least a few years, don't have gigantic gaps in their resumes, and ideally have some outside interests that suggest additional skill (we hired a guy who did blacksmithing once who was a very solid team member). I take note of spelling / formatting mistakes as well. \n\nWhat are other things you all look for that is helpful for attracting strong employees?",

I turned the water shut-off in the house, did the work, and went to turn the water back on and it is not working at all.

They understand that the valve would likely break when turned regardless of whether I turned the water off or they did.  They've given me no indication that they expect me to cover the costs, and I haven't said that I would pay for it (nor that I would expect them to pay for it).  So far, they've been wonderful to work for (very agreeable, friendly, the whole nine), so I don't see a situation arising where they start being dickish about it.  I just haven't had something like this happen yet, and I'd like to know how to deal with it this time and in the future. \n\nAny advice on how to broach the subject would be appreciated, as well as for how to navigate the discussion should they become adamant that I pay for it.  Also, I'll take any suggestions for language to put into future contracts so I'll always have something to fall back on and say   \n\"this is how we have already agreed we'd handle this type of thing.

After a year, I have seen that it truly does have a huge impact. \n\nWe have a written \"How To\" for Insurance Agency Owners. Teaches/Trains them to be Agency Owners, not just an employee, how to actually run a business.  I have a hard time selling things I don't believe in, but I've talked with all our past clients, and even did some of their testimonials. The coaching changes lives for real and their Agencies have all worked up to top performers for their companies now. We have case studies that prove this. It works, and the ROI is fast to offset cost. Problem is.... MARKETING!!! \n\nEverywhere is flooded with crap  marketing and crap services and scams. How on Earth can I reach real Agency owners? I cold call, they get 100s a day. I email, send mailers. Do messaging. Like how are you suppose to stand out anymore? \n\nI guess my question is.. How do I reach out to Agency Owners effectively? As an Agency Owner, how would you want to be contacted?",

We have a group chat and use emails, plus occasional in-person meetings for campaigns.\n\nThe problem is that everyone works differently. The only way we can see what is happening is by being told or by asking. Which is inefficient as you can imagine. Too much ambiguity, assumptions and confusion.\n\nNone of us are full time so this can slow down simple tasks dramatically. I don't like relying on text messages/emails to find out info. A lot of it could be put into a spreadsheet or some kind of database that everyone can reference.\n\nInstead we all have our own ways of organising info and files, none of it really shared.\n\nFor context, this business manufactures and sells physical products. I manage ecomm, warehouse, some design, marketing and website content. Basically all rounder.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy preferred method is a simple google spreadsheet. It's free and doesn't require new accounts and learning the software. But I know there are dedicated services like Monday. Or even Trello, although that was kinda going to shit the last time I used it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAre you in a similar position with having to disseminate project info/progress across multiple people? \n\nWhat do you use and what have you tried in the past?",

Ive made 3 websites including mine now and i am getting more customers. \n\n  \nWith this only being a sidehustle ive not planned for the sudden increase of customers, and thought i should try to do this a bit more professioanlly. \n\n  \nHowever i've come across some issues and was wondering if people could clarify or point me in the right direction. \n\n***-Hosting-***\n\nI used Kinsta for Wordpress hosting but $30 usd per month is too much especially when people's budgets are limited. Ive had some reads through similar threads and seen some hosting providers that do it as cheap as under \u00a35 a month.\n\n*With that, what is the best way to approach this?* \n\n1. Get the customer to sign up on the platform and i ask for access to their account?\n\n2. I pay for the hosting and charge the customer monthly payments.\n\n3. Use some form of Hybrid and go for a Agency account? (Eg Ionos https://www.ionos.co.uk/agency-partner)\n\n***-Payment-***\n\n1. If i host the website for the customer for \u00a33 p/m could i charge the customer \u00a315 p/m and pocket the profit?\n\n2. How do you create invoices for customer, im guessing a *whatapp \"\u00a3150 please\"*, doenst really work? \n\n3. Is it a good idea to charge maintenence plans, or charge per hour work. What seems to be the best pricing model for customers, where its win win. \n\n  \n***-Hosting Providers-***\n\nFrom what i could find, the decent providers ive come across are:\n\n  \nKrystal Hosting\n\nIonos \n\nBlue Host\n\nAre there are any good ones out there ive missed / should look at?\n\n  \n***-Lastly-***\n\nIs there anythign im missing to doign this / or some DO's or DON'Ts? \n\n  \nThank you for the time :-) ",

I am hoping that I can lean into the wealth of experience available here and find a person(s) who wouldn\u2019t mind guiding me a little through a few things and be my server/developer contact point while I\u2019m exploring costs and requirements for this project.\u00a0\n\nof \n\n**Questions:**\u00a0\n\nLet me get straight to the question and then I\u2019ll expand on the business venture after.\u00a0\n\nThe app I want to create will require some heavy server access and storage. \u00a0The app will be a stripped-back social media platform (very limited feature set).  I have created the table below with what I would expect to be the average customer usage and the resulting storage and transfer requirements per user per month (note, that the usage amounts may seem low, but that is how the app will operate \u2013 see further below for a quick overview of app intentions):\n\n|Action|Quantity p/mo|Transfer (MB)|Storage (MB)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Upload 3 min video|15|2700|2700|\n|Watch 3 min video|200|36000|0|\n|Upload photo|150|750|750|\n|View photo|4500|22500|0|\n|Misc browsing/data transfer||1000|1000|\n\nMy first question is does this look right to you? \u00a0And if so, I\u2019m thinking that my storage and transfer needs will cost me about \u00a30.90 per user per month.\u00a0\n\nThis venture will be a non-profit, so I will look to reduce operating costs wherever possible. \u00a0I\u2019d be looking at cloud servers to allow for the ease of scaling. \u00a0But one other option I was thinking about was using a decentralised storage solution. I\u2019ve never used this before, so in your opinion, would this be a good solution?\u00a0\n\nBy the end of year one, I would be looking for a setup that supports 100,000 users and then doubling at an absolute minimum year on year. \u00a0Do you have any idea what other server costs I would need to allow for, for example, hosting, will I need specific server packages, compute needs, security and then there are things like load balancers, etc. \u00a0I need help here to work out what the costs would be per month.\u00a0\n\nI completely understand that I will need a CTO, but at the moment, I am just going through the initial idea phase and pinning down the basic requirements and costs.\u00a0\n\nI am under no illusion how big of an endeavour this is and how the costs will escalate incredibly quickly.\u00a0\n\nAny help would be useful, thanks. \u00a0And if this does take off, I will be looking to staff up on developers both full, contract and consulting \u2013 so you never know, there may even be an opportunity here for yourselves.\u00a0\n\n**Quick overview of the concept:**\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m looking to develop a social media app that focuses on stripping out the negative effects, both mentally and socially, of social media. \u00a0This includes removing the business side of things such as influencers and company advertising and instead promoting real social connections and improved wellbeing through how the app forces the user to use it. \u00a0Additional benefits would also be advertising non-profit and charitable organisations, raising awareness, reducing fake news and promoting improved mental health opportunities.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a user-first initiative that hopes to rewrite how we use social media. \u00a0It\u2019s not a replacement for the common-place social platforms, but it is an alternative to disconnect a little and to become more responsible and aware of yourself and your usage.\u00a0\n\nThanks to anyone who has made it this far!\n\n\u00a0",

Being that this is my last year of college I have a less busier schedule and plan on going out and focusing on the sales part. As the title states I want to get a website for my company that describes what we do, pictures of what we do, reviews and even an inquiry form. I do not care for payments or purchases through the website as I am service based. \n\nI\u2019ve done a little research a gathered that I should buy my domain with something like google/microsoft365 then build it with something like Wordpress. \n\nAm I on the right track or what other platforms should I use?

            "description": "Hi all, I\u2019m exploring an SBA 504 loan for a real estate-based event venue business in Central California and would love input on chances of approval and any factors I may need to address.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the financials and background:\n\n\u2022 Loan Amount: \\~$3.5M to construct the facility; We have about $1M equity in the property through land acquisition and cost of permits making our injection well over 20% required for startup projects. \n\n\u2022 Real estate Collateral: \\~$2.7M in real estate holdings (across multiple properties)\n\n\u2022 Liquidity: \\~$20K cash on hand, additional securities of \\~$850K, and \\~600K in retirement accounts\n\n\u2022 Annual Household Income: \\~$600K (prior to transition into the new business)\n\n\u2022 Debt Obligations: \\~$1.45M in mortgages across personal and investment properties; $120K annually in mortgage payments, credit cards and other contractual liabilities.\n\n\u2022 Direct Industry Experience: No prior direct experience in event venue operations; however, we have hospitality experience managing multiple Airbnb properties, overseeing guest services, operations, and property management.\n\n\u2022 Indirect Industry Experience: Strong background in product management, operations, and business planning, including managing multimillion-dollar projects at bay area tech companies. \n\n\u2022 Outside Source of Income: One spouse remains employed, while the other is transitioning full-time into the business\n\n**Projected Financials (First Two Years)**\n\n\u2022 Year 1 Revenue: \\~$360,000 (primarily through site rentals, based on comparisons and market research)\n\n\u2022 Year 1 Net Income: \\~$190,376 (41% margin), based on detailed cost breakdown. \n\n\u2022 Year 2 Revenue Growth: +20% (Projecting \\~$503,000 revenue)\n\n\u2022 Year 2 Net Income: \\~$322,000 (Efficiency gains keeping cost increases minimal)\n\n**Expected debt service:** Assuming a $3.5M loan at an 8.75% blended rate with a 25-year term, the annual debt service is estimated at $354K. We anticipate being able to cover debt service from business cash flow starting in Year 2, with personal income bridging any shortfall in Year 1.\n\n**Would appreciate any thoughts on:**\n\n1. Likelihood of securing SBA 504 approval given the numbers above.\n\n2. Potential concerns lenders might raise and how to mitigate them. For example, would lenders expect to cover debt service 100% starting year 1 for a startup project like this, or we can use personal funds to augment working capital?\n\n3. Other financing alternatives (commercial loans, private lending) that might be better for cash flow.\n\n4. Any additional factors I should prepare for in the underwriting process.",

It was always awkward, and some people would just blatantly ignore me and realize they could get away with extra time paying.   \n  \nI was helping my buddy, who was a business lender, look for a collection agency to deal with past-due accounts.  Most agencies would not work with them unless they had over $1M in past-due accounts per month which was kinda steep for them so they kinda left on their own. We decided to run an experiment to see if we could automate with AI agents collecting past-due accounts in a friendly way over phone, SMS, and email. We even tried letters as well which is interesting. We found a pretty interesting sweet spot because SMBs and smaller lenders just have to deal with this on their own because the size doesn't make sense for agencies. \n\nWithin the first month, we saw very promising results. 3x engagement and payment over their current efforts. We now help them and are helping other SMBs deal with automating accounts receivables. \n\nWe are still very early and looking for more partners to help us give feedback on our product. We don't charge anything and right now only charge a 5% success for collecting on past due balances but this pricing may change. We want to offer more services around invoicing besides being an AI collecting agency. \n\nWe would love to chat with anyone who will give us feedback and is VERY OPINIONATED. Thank you!  ",

            "description": "Not sure who needs to hear this, but many small businesses can benefit from these tips on utilizing the power of an SBA 7(a) loan. This program can help pay off debt or provide simple working capital loans with a 10-year term and interest rates typically ranging from WSJ Prime + 1% to 6%.\n\n**The basics on qualifying:** \n\n* Most banks prefer to see a credit score of 675 or higher for SBA 7(a) loans. Yes, your personal credit will be reviewed, there's no way around it. However, if you have assets (such as business equipment, business property, or personal property) to fully secure the loan, some lenders may accept credit scores as low as 640. Additionally, several lenders only perform a soft inquiry initially, so exploring your options won\u2019t necessarily impact your credit score.\n* For credit worthy clients, there are loan options with some banks going up to $500,000 with no personal property or asset attachments, only business. \n* Most banks rely on the E-Tran score (SBA proprietary scoring system) which isn't just regularly available. You need to  apply for the loan to find out what this is. The closes correlating business score is the SBSS score which usually falls in line about 10 points give or take. Plenty of banks will work with the scores at 165 or more. 170 or better qualifies you for a quicker funding. \n* Some banks have Express loan programs that can lend 33% of your total gross income up to $150,000. Others can do 25% of your gross income up to $200,000. As long as you do not show a huge loss. (tolerance for losses) Multiple banks are available with credit over 700 for this, & a handful will work with personal credit at 675 or better, but have more restricted industries. (other factors like over exposure on MCA debt could turn this down, but do have a tolerance for that) These rates are usually higher at WSJ Prime + 3%-6%\n* You can use an SBA loan for large equipment purchases. \n* Know you will be giving a Personal Guarantee on any SBA loan. \n* No prepayment penalty - No balloon payment\n* Summary: With good credit, you can get affordable financing up to $200k with a small loss, but ideally looking for $1 or more in net revenue. If you run a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of at least 1-1, a business could qualify to fill that gap between $200k - $500k. If you need more insight on how DSCR is calculated, feel free to DM me. Going over $500k is a much deeper conversation, & needs a story with full Debt Service Coverage. (1 - 1.25) You can also have a great business plan with assumptions & projections, but also a much bigger conversation. Moral of the story, SBA loans require a lot more for over $500k. \n\n**Underwriting will also usually do a deep dive on background, but usually explanations or clarity can help them get past the background items if they are old & closed:** \n\n* could question prior BK's & get an explanation even if over 10 years. Usually does not cause roadblocks if past 3 years on BK. \n* Any court cases or judgements against you or the business can be questioned\n* Banks can trace all UCC history & require you close out accounts if the lender or filer has not. It happens all the time that a loan was paid off lets say 6 years ago & a lender did not remove the UCC\n* There are also plenty of other items that could come up when going over background, but these are the most frequently questioned. \n\n  \n**Documents that are usually required for an SBA Loan:**\n\n* Year to Date P&L & Balance Sheet\n* 3 years business & personal tax returns (if business is new & only have 2 years of business taxes, you are ok to proceed, but need at least 2 years of business tax returns\n* SBA - Form 413 - Personal Financial Statement\n* SBA - Form 1919 - Application\n* Debt Schedule \n* Equipment/Asset List\n* Payoff information on all loans being consolidated\n* Multiple Entity Addendum\n* 8821 or 4506 - Tax Authorization Form - standard to verify accuracy of tax returns & tax liability exposure\n* Some banks require 6 months of bank statements to measure for liquidity\n* Articles of Incorporation\n* Verification of Liability Insurance, & Workers Comp Insurance (not required in all states)\n* Business Personal Property Insurance check - Frequently asked for, but also frequently waived as a request by the lender, but not in all instances. \n\nThis is just a summary of whats out there for simple debt consolidation & working capital with what documents you will need. There could be less or a lot more needed, every business application is unique & different, & so can a banks requirements. Not all banks are equal & working with a SBA broker to navigate you to the best term, path of least resistance depending on the circumstances, & fit for your industry are important. \n\nFeel free to DM me with questions & how we could help, also happy to connect once I see your a real person! \n\n  \n\\- Grey Smith \n\n  \n\n\n",

I have been developing an AI  assistant that received the call and would then ask the costumers if they need help with sales or service, if they needed help with sales it would transfer the call with a salesman but if it needed to make a service appointment then the AI would make it themselves. Any other questions that the AI wouldn't be able to solve, it would transfer to a human. The voice sounds very good, I have been testing a lot of them and I notice it is an AI but my grandpa (he is 66) does not.\n\nDo you think that if the AI was good enough this would work, or would people that realize it is an AI reject the idea even if the AI worked better and faster than a human?",

The pros here are flexibility and the fact that QuickBooks is a proven tool with great features. However, it would mean managing multiple platforms and potentially more manual effort.\n\nMy Dilemma\n\nI\u2019d prefer to use fewer apps and programs to keep things simple. But at the same time, I know it\u2019s more important to set up a system that works best for me in the long run\u2014even if it means sacrificing a bit of convenience now.\n\nSo, what would you recommend? Have any of you had good or bad experiences with banks that cater to small business owners? Is it worth going with an online bank with built-in tools, or should I stick to a more traditional bank and rely on something like QuickBooks?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!",

            "description": "I'm sure many of you had people who didn't believe in you, so I'm asking for your help in convincing my partner before I lose the relationship over my business plan.\n\n\nMy mom recently inherited money and I've always wanted an art gallery, so I moved across country because my mom said she'd buy me a building. I feel like at 38, it's now or never. It's a mixed use property with a house and a garage. I'm planning on selling my art in the living room and some antiques in the garage. My partner absolutely doesn't believe in me and it's breaking my heart. Everything I say, she says something back. Give me your tips to let her know everything will be fine.\n\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nIt's a small town with a couple other galleries that all cater to tourists. My art doesn't, so I have something unique.  She says the average age is 60+ in the town, and the average income is really low so no one will buy my art becauseit'snotmy demographic and Ionly sell about$200 of my paintings onlinea year, but ive never had a gallery to sell in before.\n\nI've been researching who to hire to start an llc, but she says because my checking account is negative there's not even assets to protect. \n\nI recently asked her what income taxes are (I've never owned a business before) and she keeps throwing it in my face that I don't know what I'm doing, but we all have to start somewhere. \n\nMy mom has antiques I can sell in the garage and even that she put down saying \"that's a yard sale in a garage without climate control in texas.\"\n\n\nHow can I convince her to believe in me? She's mad that I stopped paying our bills because I need to focus on my business. I want to learn about all the random stuff she's putting me down for, like getting insurance and paying taxes, but it takes time. How did you get people to believe in you?",

As a small business owner, would features like these help you or your team stay organized?\n2. What\u2019s missing in existing task management tools for busy entrepreneurs?\n3.

The majority of my clients are in my city (a major metropolitan area on the east coast) and I\u2019d say the Pacific Northwest is my other \u201chotspot.\u201d Now, in year two, I am hoping to see even more growth. \n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to spread the word further? I\u2019d love to be able to help people from areas that are underserved and/or where I do not have any personal contacts. ",

            "description": "I'm trying to dig my way out, but this is an intimidating beast I am staring down.\n\nFirst:\u00a0**I know I need an accountant.**\u00a0I am trying to get my books as straight as possible before hiring one, so that I'm not just dumping a mess in their laps, causing headaches, and ratcheting up my bill higher than it needs to be.\n\nTL;DR: Accountant filed taxes for 2017 & 2018, I am not sure whether or not I filed from 2019 - 2022, I don't have access to statements for charged off credit cards and closed bank accounts, and I'm not sure how to finally set up my books.\n\nBusiness timeline:\n\n2017 - Sole proprietor, accountant filed taxes\n\n2018 - S corp, accountant filed taxes\n\n2019 - S corp, uncertain if filed\n\n2020 - S corp, uncertain if filed\n\n2021 - S corp, uncertain if filed\n\n2022 - S corp, uncertain if filed\n\n2023 - S corp, filed on my own via TurboTax\n\n2024 - S corp, going to hire an accountant after I at least have all my transactions marked down\n\nBusiness Focus: Sales of ebooks\n\nEssentially, I had a mental health breakdown at the end of 2018/early 2019, and my business revenue started tanking over the course of 2019 due to me intermittently advertising the ebooks available and not creating new ones. My accountant was charging about $2k/year to file my corporate taxes, and I just flat out couldn't afford that from 2019 to present, which is why I stopped having an accountant. I miss her dearly, she was an invaluable source of information and expertise, and if I ever get my income back up I will beg her forgiveness for my shoddy communication of terminating our relationship and hope she takes me back.\n\nI, honestly am not sure if I filed anything at all from the years 2019 - 2022. Those years are a gaping black hole in my mind. I have no memory of doing it, but that's not an entirely reliable unit of measurement. Fo example, I have no memory of filing my annual report ever before last year, which I only did because I got a notice in the mail that I had to file it in XX days or my company would be terminated, and yet if I go to my state's Secretary of State website and look it up, apparently I've filed annual reports every year--late, but they're filed. I know my accountant didn't do it out of the goodness of her heart, because she emailed me receipts of the filings both years she did it, and it costs like $20 so there's no way she would have done it. Which means I must have, but my memory just doesn't hold it.\n\nI signed up for an IRS business tax account with my EIN, business name, and address from last years taxes, currently waiting to get a pin in the mail. Hopefully then I'll be able to see whether or not taxes were filed at all.\n\nI do know that I owed the IRS a considerable sum for quite a while. Like almost $6k, but I paid that this last July. According to my screenshot receipt it was for Form 941 Series - Dec 2018. As far as I know, I do not have any current outstanding debts. (I did owe a bank for a loan from 2019, but I paid that off last July as well).\n\nFrom 2017 - 2020 I was utilizing personal credit cards to pay business expenses and didn't have a business bank account. The credit cards have been charged off, so I don't have access to those statements anymore, and the personal bank accounts I was using were also closed for negative balances, so no statements for those either.\n\nFor the last several years, there hasn't been much in the way of revenue for the business. I averaged a little over $50/month in 2024. Expenses(website hosting, domain, email, newsletter, etc) have largely been paid by me transferring funds into the business bank account I opened in 2019(owner investment?) before being paid with my business debit card. I didn't consistently do this until mid 2020, though, from when I opened the account in August 2019 to about \\~July of 2020 I was using the credit cards. And for quite a while after I had some subscriptions that were business expenses on my personal debit card, which I categorized in YNAB as 'business'.\n\nEarly 2024 marked the turning of the tide for my mental health. I tried my best to file my 2023 taxes, did it with TurboTax last April, but I'm pretty sure I did it wrong. I didn't have the bandwidth then to sort through all the years of expenses to be able to hire an accountant, so I just scrambled to cobble it together on my own. IRS didn't reject it, at least. They did hit me with a $470 fee a month later, \"balance due on return or notice\". I paid that as soon as I got the letter.\n\nTo date, I still haven't created a new product, and I'm not advertising my old ones anymore either, but I am working on a new product and hope to get this plane off the ground soon.\n\nUnfortunately, the mountain of work for finding all my expenses has remained terrifying, and I didn't put any time all of last year into getting this in order, and now it's tax time again. I started a TurboTax file for 2024 and just...Idk, I feel like I should go back and fix this now.\n\nI would like some advice on how to sort this out.\n\nI have a QBO file that, according to the oldest date of a transaction in the chart of accounts, was started in January 2019 and has transactions through June 2021. But I know it's missing transactions, because if I go into the account for the Chase card I was using it doesn't have anything prior to 2020, and I was using it for business expenses as far back as 2017. And I'm not confident in the categorization of the transactions that are in there.\n\nThings I have:\n\n\\- copies of my 2017 and 2018 corporate and personal tax returns\n\n\\- the lists of expenses I gave my accountant for 2017 and 2018\n\n\\- records in YNAB from as far back as May 2020 denoting when a business expense was made with my personal checking account\n\n\\- records in YNAB from as far back as Feb 2021 categorizing what each expense in my business bank account was for (I started a separate budget in YNAB for just my business, which gives me some easier to access reports on how much I've transferred into the business and what categories I'm spending in).\n\n\\- a copy of the tax return I filed for 2023 with Turbotax\n\nThings I know where to get:\n\n\\- statements back to August 2019 for my business checking account\n\n\\- revenue records from sales vendors for all years in business\n\nThings I'm not sure about:\n\n\\- How to figure out my expenses from about January 2019 - May 2020. Only option seems to be trying to remember vendors and seeing if I have a transaction history(I know things like my web domain, hosting, email, and Adobe keeps records of my subscription payments). My business email may also be useful, maybe I could try just searching 'receipt'.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\\- Should I try to untangle the QBO account, or should I start a new one? The subscription for it is canceled.\n\n\\- The cash I transfer from personal to business checking every month, am I understanding correctly that this is considered an increase for my basis? How do I know what my basis started as when I incorporated in 2018? What's the best way to track my basis?\n\n\\- Is there an example chart of accounts for an s-corp I could look at to make sure mine is set up correctly?",

I'm not planning on washing roofs or hiring any employees, this will just be me on the ground and won't be breaking any windows (actually use low pressure when washing houses). \n\nIn regards to General Liability Insurance, is this something that I should get right off the bat? I typically would but I'm in NY and the rates I see online are very expensive for someone whose company is new, like 200+ a month. It really is a very low risk job, and the only reason I would need it would be if I did somehow damage someones property, but that price seems pretty crazy. Does this price sound normal? Maybe I need to shop around a bit more. \n\nAlso, In regards to forming an LLC, I was reading about just getting business insurance and operating as sole pro to start because really there doesn't seem to be a benefit for LLCing since it will just be me and I really can't imagine getting sued doing what I'm doing. \n\nAppreciate any advice!",

Would I just give myself a salary and take it out of the business, then split profits evenly? Would it be fair if I contributed less to the opening costs of the business?

            "description": "I am currently looking at buying a small business that I work for. I am in the roofing/construction industry. We are a small company. Its basically me and my boss (who is a family member). We have been in business over 25+ years. I have been there about 15 years. Looking online at how to value a small business, I am mostly seeing things talk about SDE. I am 1099 sales. My issue with going off of SDE is that I am bringing in a lot of business that is straight up my referrals and comes directly from me. Of the last 15 jobs that I have sold, 12 of them were customers who came directly to/from me. My boss, the owner is obviously selling his own jobs, and generally sells a bit more than me, outside of last year. But he has a pretty huge range in SDE values too. In fact I think he has an SDE around 220k one year and has a -9k SDE for last year which was a slow year for us. The track record of the company is superb. No complaints anywhere in that 25+ year history which is almost unheard of for a roofing company of that length. But there are no real employees and the value seems to mostly be in the track record and some referrals. There is definitely value in not starting a new company for me. I sold a roof the other day that I probably do not get it I had a new company and I have had a number of customers in the past who would not buy from a company without a track record. Does anyone have any experience buying a company like this? ",

That said, for this new business, I decided to make it my primary business account and have already run into a super frustrating snag - depositing a check.\n\nI deposited a check on Friday, January 24th (10 days ago), and the are still not available in account. On top of that, because of the amount ($27k), I had to ask for a transfer increase limit before I could deposit it? And also, the process of doing that was really goofy - they don't communicate what your transfer limit is in advance - so you go to deposit a check and follow the process (it tells you to endorse it), and then after you do all that, it tells you that it's above the limit and that you have to submit for manual verification. When you go to manual verification it tells now not to endorse the check...how am I supposed to not endorse it after you are already asked me to endorse it? \n\nAnd they do provide you an estimate of when the funds will be available in your account, but that's after you deposit it. If they had just told me my limit up front, and the approximate deposit date, I would've made other arrangements. Now all my vendors are looking at me funny.\n\nI love the UI so it's disappointing that this relationship is already off to a not so good start.",

Does it make a difference if we send products in a plastic mailer, bubble envelope, or a sturdy cardboard box? Will customers feel differently about the product\u2019s quality and brand perception based on how it arrives?\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear from both consumers and business owners!

We do weekly stock takes of our very small warehouse and yet always seem to fall short of stock.\n\nWe have been discussing where the errors could be coming from and have narrowed it down to double handling on our accounting software. For example, we write off stock for our salesman to bring along on visits but he will sometimes sell half of the products to clients. We then invoice what he has sold but then it has already been written off as sampling stock.\n\nWe need to record when he takes stock out of the warehouse but also don\u2019t want to essentially write off the stock twice. Does anyone have any advice to make sure we keep stock figures accurate? We have to record how much has left the warehouse but also need to make sure we invoice on the system. I want to get our books in order for the end of the financial year and I\u2019m already struggling with this one. Thank you ",

Our process is fully remote, and we\u2019ve built a secure system for handling client documents online.\n\nOne challenge I\u2019ve noticed is the growing surplus of accounting services in the market\u2014many people advertise that they \u201cdo accounting\u201d but don\u2019t have the proper licensing or relevant experience.

I accept that the first few years in business can be tough, but I\u2019d love to hear from other business owners\u2014how did you overcome this stage?\n\nAny tips on improving client conversion, engagement, or standing out in a crowded market would be greatly appreciated!

Researching this on Google and YouTube, I am seeing companies that charge a fee for this service - all of which talk about (and show) a physical card that you need to carry on you for the other person to scan, which defeats the idea of it being virtual\n\nHere are some notes:\n\n* We already have a QR code created through my Adobe account. \n* At the very minimum, we would like for the receiver to get her contact and business information, with a link to her website and to be able to add her into their contacts. \n* If possible, we'd also like a link to schedule (this would have to be through Wix), and a link to be able to provide feedback. \n\nThere seems to be a lot of companies out there (at least according to YouTube), and it is a bit overwhelming - plus again, they all talk about a physical card first. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you in advance!",

The internet is full of random advice, scams, and too many options, which makes it overwhelming.\n\nThe problems I want to solve:\n- People don\u2019t know which online business model is best for their skills, personality, and budget.\n- Many waste months (or years) jumping from one thing to another, never getting results.\n- There\u2019s a lack of clear guidance \u2013 most courses just sell a dream, but don\u2019t help you choose the right path.\n- Most people don\u2019t have a supportive community when starting out.\n\nThe idea I\u2019m working on:\n- A simple system that helps people identify the best online business model for them (based on skills, interests, personality).\n- A structured roadmap so they know what to focus on step by step.\n- A community of serious people helping each other (no spam, no hype).\n- Maybe even mentors in different fields, so once you choose a path, you get real guidance.\n\nMy questions to you:\n\t1.\tHave you ever struggled with choosing an online business? What was the hardest part?\n\t2.\tWould a system like this be useful? What would make it better?\n\t3.\tWhat\u2019s missing in the current \u201cmake money online\u201d industry that frustrates you?\n\nI appreciate any feedback, even if it\u2019s brutal! \ud83d\ude03 Thanks in advance!",

We have a local facebook group related to our industry that we are both a part of, we have weekly meetups etc. My team member is an active moderator of the group predating his employment time with me. Recently one of my long time customers has started acting out in the facebook group and in the chat. My team memeber has now threatened to ban this person from the group, which he probably does deserve in all honesty, but now this person has started slandering my business in the group. I have asked my team member to step down from the moderator position to disassociate my store from any moderator actions but my team member seems to not want to do that because he wants to try to help the group.\n\nMy question is this: is my team member being a moderator and banning people from our local facebook group a conflict of interest with the store's best interest? Am I overstepping by asking him to leave the moderator position? He does the moderator duties in his own time so I feel like I don't have too much say to try to control what he does in his personal time, but this whole thing I feel is creating trouble for the store.",

But the payroll part is where I\u2019m trying to make sure I\u2019m doing it correctly.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m calculating total payroll as wages + payroll taxes + tips on payroll. However, I believe tips should be deducted because they\u2019re not part of revenue, and if I include tips in payroll but not in revenue, the ratio would be skewed. That wouldn\u2019t make sense, right?\n\nSo the formula I\u2019m using is:\n\nPayroll to Revenue Ratio = (Total Payroll - Payroll Tips) / Net Sales (excluding tips and taxes)\n\nIs this correct?",

            "description": "My small business has been in business a few years and I have always made an estimated quarterly tax payment based on that. However this last year we went a bit viral and did 3 times the business which hit me with a big time tax bill surprise. I don\u2019t anticipate being as busy as last year. Do I still need to make estimates off last year\u2019s big numbers? Is there another strategy like just paying 30% of what I made that quarter to make sure I am not overpaying? How do you determine what you pay for estimated tax each quarter?",

            "description": "\n\nMy company is a very niche skilled trade that has about a three year training process.  I know a lot of people here don't understand that long of a training process, but it's fairly common for traditional/skilled trades.  Along that process there's progressive and substantial wage increases.  I currently have one employee that is shortly finishing this structured training process.  It could still take him another three years to get full mastery of the trade, but this is the structured/intentional part of it.\n\nSo clearly, it's not the type of thing where I really want to just be hiring willy nilly.  I feel like I have a pretty good handle now on reading a person and sensing if they will vibe with the work.  Admittedly, I've maybe been a bit TOO careful - and after two years of applicants and interviews, I just never really find someone (or they see it's not for them).\n\nRecently I'm taking more of an approach of trying to take more risks in this area - to be less afraid of investing potentially wasted time - even if I'm pretty good about reading this.  I hired a new person last week after a 4 day trial period that I sense won't probably stick with it, but again - I feel I need to take risks and change things up.  I mainly hired them because they were pretty persistent and patient (even if not necessarily for the reasons I'd prefer - i.e. persistent for the new paycheck as opposed to the new exciting opportunity) - also they are extremely conscientious and tick all the boxes of a great employee.  My sense of concern is simply that I don't think they may find the work as interesting as I assume someone should be to do this.  \n\nSorry for the length here, but I'm curious if others employing in skilled trades or otherwise have come up against biases of what they think an employee should be - and maybe you just needed to learn that there are truly different types?  Like maybe there are types that are \"put your head down and work\" and maybe there are others that are \"passionate about the work\".  Like....different but both valid motivations?",

I know there is the route of ROBS (existing business is a c-corp), but if it came down to it, would there be any issue pulling some from our 401k (understanding the tax implications of pulling early)?\n\nLastly, my wife\u2019s parents have funds available to us, but I\u2019m not sure how best to receive said funds. I read that only $5,000 can be \u201cgifted\u201d for equity injections? Can they loan us the money another way?\nI also read that we could give them equity for these funds and then buy them out at a later time. Any opinions on the best route?\n\n\nThanks for any insights! I\u2019ll spare the details unless needed, but you can assume every other aspect of this is an ideal SBA lending opportunity (imo). I just keep reading how strict lenders are on where this equity injection can come from (i.e. no \u201cborrowed\u201d money) so I\u2019m curious on what options are possible. \n",

ADP made the comment that Gusto essentially gets the brokerage fees without actually providing brokerage services. \n\n  \nSo I'm shopping for the switch for a bit. I recently received a quote from ADP and the pricing are very comparable because they are a partner with the bank we do business with. However.....they do not have the expense management nor the time off management (request/approval button and get pulled directly into payroll). So that means we will have to keep track of expenses and people's time off request every month and manually enter into payroll. These two functions are built into Gusto so we loved that.\n\n  \nI wonder if anyone has any experience how to make this easier if we do make the switch. I am worried this will add tedious work to our admin person (who is unfortunately slow). \n\n  \nThoughts appreciated! thank you!",

            "description": "Hello!  My business has recently needed to move away from absorbing the fees that are tacked on with any credit card purchase.  We are a B to B offset and digital print company, and some of our invoices were getting too large to absorb the roughly 3% of invoices when a client decided to pay via CC.  We do not force our clients to pay via CC, we offer them the ability to pay debit, by check with net 30 approved terms, or ACH.  We believe the flexibility to avoid the fee is important, however there are those that still insist on paying via CC.  I get it there are a lot of protections that come with this methodology.  \n\n  \nOur strategy instead of just blanket increasing our prices by 3% was to make sure we did not punish everyone to manage our runaway fee costs.\n\n  \nThat being said we have had a hard time finding a credit card processing company that will allow us to add the 3% cost to our invoices, and create an easy enough to use web interface for charging cards and generating receipts.  \n\n  \nOur goal is to find a way to send to clients the ability to make a credit card payment online.  Via a payment link or portal that will securely take the information, and charge the card for the funds needed on an invoice.\n\nThe problem we have been facing is my AR can create a link to pay for a specific invoice, however she is not alerted via email or notifications that someone has paid for an invoice this way, we were hoping for some sort of instant alert so we can clear a payment and then either finish a product for a client or release it for delivery if it is considered CoD.\n\n  \nThe other issue is if my AR can make a specific invoice payment link, our clients do not get an instant receipt on their paying causing us to need to do another touch point of generating that to send to them.  \n\n  \nBefore all of this we had a very easy to use payment portal system for people to make payments, get receipts, and even alerted our AR so actions can be done to release a product for clients.  Their big stoppage was the 3% fee, they said we were not allowed to add it to credit card payments beginning this whole process.\n\n  \nDoes anyone deal with anything similar?  We are open to paying for a credit card processing firm for these features, just need to be able to include the 3%  \n\n  \nThanks yall!",

I program automatic inspection machines sold as a per-hour service and sell fixtures I build to hold parts in the machine. It's not complicated, and I don't have a ton of customers. \n\nIn a past life, I have used: Oracle, JobBoss, RealTrac, quickbooks, and Sage. I spent a ton of time trying out ERPNext via Frappe cloud server, and it was not a great experience. I see a lot of potential there, but I need to focus on the customer, not debugging my customer management. I don't like all the work-arounds I had to do in Sage, though it's decent software. I like Quickbooks, but it's missing a lot. \n\nMy biggest pain point is managing customer and vendor data: creating a job, associating documents with that job, tracking work done on it, and being able to assess whether we made any money are what I'm after. I don't need payroll, website connection, sales management, inventory management, etc. I need lite CRM, document management, and enough accounting to make due, ideally something an accountant is going to like dealing with. Is this obviously Quickbooks? Any add-ons I should be investigating?\n\nAdd: GNUCash was the answer I needed several years ago. Unfortunately, it's not pro enough for me now, so I'm back with ERPNext V15 on Frappe. ",

Other ideas have popped up like maybe a cake decor class once or twice a month. Ofc I have other side hustle ideas too like paintings and dog breeding but baking is my main passion. \n\nIn your very honest opinion would this seem like something thay could hit well and is there other ideas for it that should be added or taken away from?",

And I having wanted to get off the road, and have more responsibility, was promoted into this Ops Manager role. And I am having issue with acclimating to the role with being the leader/boss of the people that trained and mentored me as a Tech for the 5 years prior. \n\nContext:  \nOur Field Tech team consists of 6 guys, all ranging in age from 51 to 68, I was previously the youngest tech at 27, and am now the Ops Manager. While I was a tech, I was the only person that was within the same state as our operating office, so as long as the tech is within an hour of an airport they can live anywhere they want. \n\nFor what its worth, I had some management background as an Assistant Manager when I was 21/22 @ McDonalds(28 now). From how I felt as a Tech in those 4 years after 1 year of training, you're basically always working solo, and with that, there really isn't much \"management\" that has to be done. You are told what customer to go to, and the tech makes there own travel arrangements from there, orders parts accordingly, without much communication back to the office. Not sure if this the way it is supposed to be or just poor management by the coordinator. My boss tells me to not compare myself to him, but I can't help but think about it. He had no technical expertise in general and or with this equipment, and had no management experience to boot. \n\nI find myself saying \"do you want to go to \"xyz\" customer?\", knowing what each tech's relationship with various customers. I feel the need to be more assertive, like \"this is your job next week\". But I don't want to step on toes and or hurt the relationships I've built with these guys. ",

            "description": "Hello team. I have owned my coffee shop for 5 years as of today. I am really proud of that accomplishment. Although I have done a lot to update pricing strategies over the years, I have a huge remodel coming up and after we open back up, I really want to use it as an opportunity for a reset in pricing strategy. 4 out of 6 of our full time girls have been with me for 4 years or more. I no longer work in my coffee shop and continue to build opportunities with the business -  not just in the business, and it is because of their dedication to our community.\n\nI want the opportunity to be a healthy business while also focusing on increasing benefits and value of employment with me so they feel appreciated for their loyalty and do not become complacent or stagnant. All of these things obviously come at a cost. I have 2 questions rolled into one. \n\n1) Previously I have priced my menu using blanket averages. The average hot drink and iced drink cost x to produce, divided by 20% which equals 5.45 for the normal hot and iced drinks. This means that lattes, cappuccino, Americanos, and chai were priced the same to avoid guest confusion. This is the first thing I am seeking feedback on. Is this a sufficient model or should I price each drink as it's own consideration. Obviously modifiers, extras, and blended drinks all cost differently. Even so, I'm not sure it's fair to the Americano person that they essentially subsidize the latte person, although sales have been very consistent and do not show signs of fear of pricing strategy. If anyone has feedback for me here I'd love to hear it.\n\n2) food pricing and pastry pricing. I used supply and demand modeling for food. Popular items like our bacon double egg and cheese on a bagel would be priced at 30 - 35% COG. Pastries, which are delivered pre packaged at our shop and warmed up to go, are priced at 60% COG because it's really just an additional hand held that I am trying to push ticket sale averages with. Food that wasn't in high demand or that we offered to get people in the door, I would price at 50% COG. \n\nI have worked a delicate balance to keep a gross profit margin of no less than 60% average across all items sold in a given month.\n\nAs I begin to expand my horizons, I wanted to get peoples thoughts on lowering my COG formula for food and pastries to be more profitable and whether in your opinion, if it would affect my net customer count by turning away people who would have otherwise bought something with their high profit drink. \n\nRather than drinks subsidizing food and pastries, and certain drinks subsidizing other drinks, I am considering maintaining a high profit on drinks while also reducing my COG % formula which will increase food and pastry prices, but i do not want to do it at the expense of my guests leaving or not buying. \n\nPlease consider in your reply that even a 5% move down in COG pricing formula can often add any where from 1 dollar to 2.25 extra to the cost of a product in my shop.\n\nHas anyone done something similar and had success or failure? \n\nThank you for your time ",

My name is Bobby and I currently have 8 or more years of experience in different fields of construction however the main one I\u2019m focused on is Log home restoration! I currently live in southeast unfortunately and pine log homes are not a huge thing lol however my experience consist of log home restoration from brand new builds usually well mainly custom built homes from British Columbia which range in the millions to Turk key log homes that were bought with the owners intention to give the home some new life! A old home would consist of a complete spray down with a eco-safe proprietary blend of cleaner to power wash the home from top to bottom. Afterwards extreme care is given to check every inch of the home for any rot or sun burnout. We would then give the home a less intense type of sanding like procedure and then respray the home with a maintenance coat of the original homes tint and product done every few years to maintain the homes integrity. We also (which I enjoy the much) is apply a chinking to the home per the customers specifications which usually is for giving the home a more attractive look while some homes it\u2019s needed to keep out dirt or sand that may blow in through separations in certain spots between logs. \n\nNew builds the multimillion dollar homes are usually in the 8-50 million range before they even start anything else due to quality of wood chose from British Columbia lumbar yards usually extremely unique cedar type logs. After these logs sit so long and the company comes and puts the cabin together usually my Jon would be to fly out and they sand or (Osborn) the entire building every square inch of wood to remove a outer layer capable of absorbing the stain and giving it a amazing look! However most of this work is done throughout the country but the southeast is notorious for not being able to handle the humidity without rotting the logs and sourcing cedar and quality. But I apologize the purpose of this post is I want to get back into this work with even possibly starting a small business focused just on those aspects of the business. I\u2019m just looking for advice or guidance from anyone who may be experienced in the occupation or just in running a business in general! Thank u everyone! \n\nTL:DR-wanting to start a small business or get back into loghome restoration business with starting my own company in the near future and needing some guidance and advice from experienced and successful business owners!

When I signed up a year ago, I was told the Visa high-risk fee would be $500 per year. Fast forward a year, and I was charged a shocking $4,500 USD!!!  \n\nI called customer service, but they said the fee went up. I received no notice of this change, and it was never part of the original agreement. When I asked for a correction, they refused. Customer service pointed me to the sales team, but the sales team claimed they had no control over the fee changes and blamed a lack of resources for not informing customers. They both kept passing the buck with no resolution.  \n\nThis massive fee is financially crippling my small business. I have recorded calls confirming the $500 per year fee. Is this bait and switch? Do I have grounds for small claims court against Moneris for misrepresentation?  \n\nAny advice on what steps I should take next would be greatly appreciated.  ",

            "description": "Currently, I run a small farm that focuses on producing and selling, but I rely on intermediaries to find a buyer. My vision is to transform this operation into a fully integrated farm-to-table approach. By handling the entire process from production and processing to direct distribution we can eliminate intermediaries, reducing the costs for consumers, and streamline our supply chain for maximum efficiency. This model will not only make food more affordable but will also enhance the transparency and sustainability of our agricultural practices.\n\nI\u2019m currently exploring an alternative funding methods for my agricultural project, aiming to minimize reliance on traditional banking systems. I\u2019ve considered selling Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a fundraising tool. Unlike conventional crowdfunding approaches, NFTs not only provide a unique opportunity to raise capital but also allow us to connect with a global audience supporting impactful, future-forward initiatives.\n\nMy objective is to raise $2 million to fuel this expansion. While this might seem like a large goal, it is essential to cover the key expenses needed to expand our operations, including purchasing machinery, acquiring additional land, building facilities, and hiring staff. This capital will enable us to build a scalable, sustainable ecosystem that integrates production, processing, and distribution in a way that maximizes efficiency while benefiting the community. Ultimately, this project will create a more equitable food system, providing consumers with affordable alternatives.\n\nIn addition to the core expansion, any excess funds raised will be strategically allocated toward the development of a utility token within our ecosystem. This token will serve as a digital medium of exchange, allowing customers to buy and sell our farm products seamlessly while promoting a circular, decentralized economy. We also plan to develop a dedicated blockchain to enhance transparency, traceability, and operational efficiency, ensuring that every transaction is secure, clear, and efficient.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency and blockchain will play an important supporting role in our initiative, they are not the primary focus of our fundraising efforts.\n\nThe central goal is to build a resilient, sustainable agricultural model that empowers consumers to access more affordable food options. Through this farm-to-table initiative, we aim to disrupt the traditional agricultural supply chain, reduce costs, and create a more equitable and sustainable food system for everyone.\n\nI appreciate any feedback, suggestions, and support from the community. Thank you, fellow Redditors!",

Last fall, I changed my tax filing to Scorp and will file for the first time under Scorp in the next couple of weeks. \n\nWhen setting up payroll I did NOT want to use my daily operating expenses checking account, I guess my thought process was to keep the payroll and daily operating accounts separate. Bank couldn\u2019t open a new checking account under the same EIN because of the name (if I recall correctly)\n\nThat lead me to make a new EIN and use that new account for my payroll . That new EIN number was also used to register at the Department of Revenue of my state. I pay the income tax and unemployment tax using the new EIN. \n\nMy question is should I file the 1120s with the new EIN ? Or file under the first EIN? Please note I converted the first EIN to an Scorp so both EINs are SCorp.\n\nMy first EIN has all my expenses and income. Thats where I deposit all my checks. I kept that account because my checks are not put on hold and money is accessible instantly, which is great for my concrete business. That\u2019s my daily operating checking account. My new EIN has strictly payroll. \n\nI did sent out 1099s with the first EIN numbers \ud83d\ude12 not sure if I\u2019m digging my own grave at this point . \n\nShould I just file under the new EIN?

A few informative videos pointed to creating a Wyoming LLC that holds trading brokerage account for privacy and protection and your own state LLC taxed as C-corp, which holds a portion of the Wyoming LLC in partnership with yourself. Since IRS allows for \"guaranteed payment\" to partners which here is from Wyoming LLC to your C-corp for providing management services, that can then be offset against various business tax deductions with the main goal of netting out the C-corp income to near zero to avoid paying any extra C-corp taxes and reducing the LLC/personal taxes.\n\nI just created my two entities/business (LLCs) through zenbusiness but have questions before electing as C-corp.\n\n1. Is this an optimal tax structure where, Iam expecting to be a solo entrepreneur and don't have plans to expand now, save on taxes and protect my accounts.\n2. Is the C-corp (flat tax rate) an advantageous election than an S-corp (pass through tax) or just an LLC if the goal is to have near zero income for the C-corp?\n3.

What worked for you?\n\t\u2022\tAre there any affordable rental options, creative storage ideas, or temporary workspace setups I might not be thinking of?\n\t\u2022\tIf you\u2019ve converted a small space into a functional work area, what helped the most?\n\nI\u2019d love any ideas\u2014whether it\u2019s a clever storage hack, a rental option, or just a way to make things feel less chaotic. Thanks in advance for any advice!",

            "description": "Hey everyone, I recently started my own snow removal and home maintenance business, and I just landed my first big client. I did a 5-hour snow removal job with two other workers (who I paid $25/hr each), using high-end snowblowers, shovels, and manual labor to remove built-up snow/ice that had been accumulating since the start of winter. It was heavy work, involved breaking apart layers of ice, and required significant machine use.\n\nI originally planned to charge $110\u2013$125 per hour for snow removal, which I thought was fair given the labor, equipment costs, and the fact that many pro snow removal companies charge $100\u2013$250 per hour (especially for labor-intensive jobs that aren\u2019t just plowing a driveway). However, my construction boss, who\u2019s been in business for 30+ years, told me I\u2019m charging way too much and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t even charge numbers like that\u201d for the work they do.\n\nNow I\u2019m second-guessing myself. I\u2019m trying to grow my business, and I want to be competitive but also get paid fairly for my time, equipment, and effort. He suggested charging $40/hr if I\u2019m working solo, which seems really low considering expenses, gas, equipment wear, and the physical labor involved.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is my pricing fair? Should I lower my rates while I\u2019m still growing, or am I undervaluing my work if I go lower? Would love insight from small business owners, tradespeople, and others in snow removal or service-based businesses.",

It will be slow, and it will be the most expensive option, but the company has a reputation in the community for going far more than just one extra mile.\n* In the local industry, a company needs to make a Gross Margin of 25% on jobs for the company to break even on the fixed costs. A job MUST beat 25%, and generally needs at least 30% Gross Margin\n* A job could have a Gross Margin in the 20%-50% range depending on many factors (better margins come only with small jobs); it generally sits between 30%-35%\n* For a theoretical job, we could say that the most/least expensive invoices would be $50k/$2k\n\nNow, the company wants to share a specific percentage of every dollar made, past a 30% margin. We have already taken care of all other employees except the office staff. The company might clear 1-3 jobs per week.

Does the company pay bills through the business account or through our personal account (once the money has passed through into our account) ?\nIn my mind the flow of money would be something like this: the business makes money, we pay the bills of the company, we pay the reasonable salary to ourselves, the remaining money is passed through to the owners, then we pay taxes for both ourselves and the company. \n2. If we pay the bills through personal account, and there are two of us, who pays the bills, how does that even work?\n3. How does paying health insurance work? Does the company pay us a certain amount to cover the cost of our personal health insurance and it\u2019s a deduction? Or does a company get health insurance like a regular company and it just pays the cost of the health insurance for us?\n4. How does the corporate veil work with an S Corp? I\u2019m a little confused because it\u2019s a pass-through company so I\u2019m seeing a lot of things mixed which in my mind would open me up to risking my home and assets if a lawsuit occurs.\n5. If you have any other advice I\u2019m open to it. obviously I have a lot to think about before I make this move and I want to make sure I have a good understanding of an s corp before I decide.\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of for right now, but I hope you guys won\u2019t mind if I have further questions a pop-up.",

            "description": "Situation part 1: \nIn 2022 I (F25) emigrated from central to northern Europe and 7mo ago I graduated MSc in a field that used to be \"prestigious\", but rn there is no job, and if there is, then for very little money (in my country barely above minimum wage, here - average or slightly below). I didn't manage to get any internship or job until now (applied to ~100 places, cv and portfolio verified by professionals), so I'm currently working in a wait-over job (to survive) and learning a tech-related skill as a plan B. I decided to give myself time until the end of 2025 to get an internship or a job in my plan A or plan B field.\n\nSituation part 2: \nMy mom has had an accountant office since ~2010. Her name is kinda recognisable in our area in this context, she offers services for a couple supermarkets, hotels etc. She is a bad boss - not assertive, very giving, she spoiled her girls (really), they manipulate her, it became an enormous problem as my mom basically stopped having any income (after paying them) despite working ~60h a week. As the girls are fucking up more, making more mistakes, and asking for more money (they earn around double market average for the position), my mom decided to fire them one by one. There are 5 of them in total, 2 will probably stay - one has been collaborating with my mom for over 15 years, and the other is just necessary for the company to survive. Yesterday we talked and she told me about her accountant friend that has more companies than her, and that she is calm and steady cause she works only with her daughter. They rely on each other and everything goes well. \n\nMy mom asked me if I would be interested in such a deal. I told her about my 2025 plan, but that it sounds good.\n\nPros:\n- I will get decent money (we are probably talking about double average wage for the country I used to live in, an average for the country I live in now)\n- I will get into another industry guided by a great professional (plan C)\n- I'm an engineer, analytical brain, it will be quite easy for me\n- I may be able to manage the company to actually grow\n- When my mom retires, the company will be continued by me, not closed or given into stranger's hands\n\nCons:\n- I would have to move back to a country I ran away from, for at least a year\n- It may affect our relationship negatively\n- it's a minimum of 3-5 years commitment, probably longer\n- Apart from some freelance on the side, I will abandon my original industry and may have a problem to be hired back\n\nMy question is - would you do it?",

I'm wondering the best way to go about that.\n\nSo, to start off, the internet provider that we use as home is also primarily a telephone provider.  What this means is we are automatically assigned a phone number whether we want it or not and a landline plan is tied into our phone plan, whether we want it or not.  (We're locked in for life at a great rate though.) So initially I was thinking that since this business is going to be starting from home and all I need to do is buy and plug in a landline and it'll already be connected that I could just do that.  But even if we use that phone only for business and emergencies, the number would still technically be connected to us on a personal level and can be traced back to us.  \n\nSo am I better off getting a cheap phone plan with what amounts to a burner phone?  The phone number would basically be just a formality, I prefer email communication, and I still have a full time day job and will for a while, which means my accessibility via phone would be much more limited than my accessibility via email.\n\nAlso, I'm going to be putting together a business website, too, and I'm reading that one of the things I need to have ready when I register is a business email address that is ideally a (@)website email rather than something such as (@)Gmail or any other mail service.  How do I set up/obtain an email that is addressed to my website and would it be still accessible through Gmail or only through the back end of my website?",

            "description": "Hi everyone! My name is Crystal and I own a small business that specializes in wire wrapped jewelry. I\u2019ve had my business for about 5 years now and have been able to expand to the point of selling my jewelry in 5 stores (and looking to sell in more!). I also sell my jewelry on Etsy and also sell in various different vendor markets. I have been able to grow my business but I feel I have now hit a brick wall in gaining anymore growth. I have been on Etsy since I started my business but haven\u2019t had a lot of luck. I have tried everything under the sun to become successful with Etsy but have not had much luck. I have tried moving to other selling platforms as well as thought about creating my own website. The fear I have is if I move to my own website I won\u2019t be able to bring views and sales to my website since it is not a part of a bigger community like Etsy is and how it would show my products to anyone that is searching for them. I wanted to see if anyone could provide me advice as to how I could expand my business online via either Etsy still or if it\u2019s best to move to my own website and how I can make it so others can see my products without me organically bringing them on from my social media platforms. I have tried many things with SEO searches but can\u2019t seem to find the right thing to work. Any advice I would be very appreciative of. Including just business advice in general. Thank you so much!",

            "description": "Hello r/smallbusiness!\n\nI\u2019m starting up a business analyst consulting firm and diving into the world of business analytics for dental practices and wanted to start a conversation with any dentsist/dental practices. My goal is to understand whether dentists see value in working with a business analyst and if insights from practice data can help improve revenue, efficiency, and patient retention.\n\nMy first question is... do dentists even want to work with a business analyst?\n\nMost small to mid-sized practices rely a lot on their practice management software (Dentrix, Open Dental, etc.), but to my understanding, those software only generate reports that just scratch the surface of what\u2019s possible with deeper analysis.\n\nSome of the things that I have considered that a business analyst can provide for a dental practice could be things like increasing revenue by identifying the most profitable procedures, optimizing pricing, etc. Improving scheduling and operations by identifying and reducing no-shows, optimizing appointment flows, and improving productivity. And even boost patient retention by analyzing trends to increase return visits and improve marketing effectiveness.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from you all and collect any feedback or considerations you might have.\n\nIf you made it this far, drop a comment to answer:\n\nDo you see value in having someone analyze your business performance and provide clear, actionable recommendations?\n\nIf you could fix one business-related challenge in your practice, what would it be?\n\nWhat kind of data do you already track, and where do you think there are gaps?\n\nAnd since I\u2019m refining my approach, I\u2019m also offering a free business analysis trial to a limited number of practices if anyone would be interested in building case studies.\n\nThis includes: A custom report highlighting potential revenue & efficiency improvements as well as insights into scheduling, patient retention, and financial trends.\n\nNo obligation\u2014just data-driven insights tailored to your practice if anyone would be interested :).\n\nIf you\u2019re open to free insights on your practice\u2019s performance, feel free to DM me or comment below! Your feedback would be incredibly valuable as I shape this into a service that truly helps small dental practices thrive.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!",

We are in the beauty/ skincare space targeting a bit more premium demographics\n\nSince we are still working full time on our W-2 jobs, now are just finally getting time to think about social media pre launch strategy. To be completely honest, feeling a bit overwhelmed and at a loss here, since I have never done marketing, never done creatives and barely even use social media. Though I am trying to get up to speed as fast as I can, would love to hear you guys\u2019s thoughts: \n\n- Should I outsource social media content/ marketing strategy entire to a reputable agency? Since no one can be good at everything right, should I not focus more on strategy and execution? Meaning either finding an agency or some freelancers to help with drafting out marketing strategy, social media creatives (photos/ videos). I will very involved in the ideation and analytics of course\n\n- What is the best strategy here after this step (either outsourcing it or not), is there timeline/ posting targets we should be aiming for IG/ FB/ TT and Youtube? Posting everyday for instance and getting to 10k in 3 months?\n\n- Should we focus on 1 platform only? \n\n- What kinds of content should we be posting? Since we are starting from scratch no one knows about it. We have 2 followers (1 is me). Seems like hashstags are not working? How can we make sure our content/ creatives are reaching the right audience?\n\n- I have heard about: working with micro influencers - asking them promote, engaging with similar accounts and commenting on their page, doing give aways\n\nAnything else? Again, would love to hear thoughts. I am spending hours doing creatives (just still photos) and don\u2019t even look good. After posting, we only get 1 like lol. With this kind of engagement, how can we get any sale once we launch?\n",

            "description": "So basically I have an e-commerce website where I sell jewelry. I needed photos of all my necklaces on models. My some-what friend said she could shoot about 2-3 photos of each piece for $500. I will mention that we agreed upon 50 pieces total and I brought extra necklaces, however we discussed that I would pay additionally for any extra photos. The shoot came and without my permission she added another model that I did not approve of and she was 30 minutes late. It then took her another 30 minutes to set up her equipment. Also, before hand over text I mentioned that I wanted the models to do a top change in the middle of the shoot. So when the photographer was finally set up to shoot things were going nice until her flash stopped working mid shoot. We had to end early only getting through about 13 necklaces. \nI also communicated to her that the next week was going to be difficult for me to schedule around due to me having surgery. After the first shoot she was very persistent on not having me present at the next one, however me being the client I felt it was necessary for me to be at my own product shoot. Additionally, when it came time for part 2, I admit I scheduled everything very last minute and should have made plans ahead of time. I also want to mention that during the first session I mentioned how I should have brought accessories to be styled with the necklaces being shot. I did also tell the models in a group chat with the photographer to bring multiple top options. I  wanted to add a third model to the shoot which she said would be an extra $100 which I paid. \nWhen scheduling, she mentioned that the day we choose she had blocked out for me which I assumed meant the whole day was open. When booking the studio, she said that she was only available until 4 which was not mentioned previously and interfered with my schedule but I booked according to hers. She said that we only needed 3 hours to shoot 3 models which based on the last session I expressed that I didn\u2019t think that would be enough time and she assured me that it would be plenty. \nThe day of the shoot came and we were both set up by 12 which was when the first model was to arrive, however she did not come until 12:30 which put us behind. Also, during my set up I layed out all the products for her to see and showed her what was to be shot. I also had earrings, bracelets, and rings to have the models wear which I did tell her and she saw herself. \nI booked the studio from 11:30-3 and we did not finish until around 4:30, proving my concern to be correct. Around 3:30 I asked her if she had time to continue and if it was okay with her to extend the time which she agreed to. After we finished I thought that it was a success and I was excited to see the photos. Keep in mind that I already paid her the full amount, $600 before the second session and BEFORE receiving any photos from the first one even though they were edited and complete. \nToday, she texted me saying that she could only give me 50 photos total which was not what we agreed upon and I believe is not fair for the price. I am also very inexperienced with shooting and she is the second photographer I\u2019ve worked with. She also mentioned to me that some of the pieces were shot extra, which was only true of one necklace that I honestly did not know we had already done because it was hard to see from the gallery she sent me with huge watermarks over all the photos. She complained that I had the bracelets, earrings and rings in the shots and the model changes however all of this was in fact discussed beforehand!! \nShe also told me that there was \u201clittle to no organization\u201d, she \u201cworked over the time she agreed to work\u201d, and that I never communicated to her that I\u2019d be adding extra pieces (which I in fact did). Here is what she sent me:\n\u201cBut 9.5 hours of shoot time, two locations shoots days, 5 models with outfit changes and provided wardrobe, and 75 necklaces plus earrings and bracelets and rings would normally cost you upwards of $3500 minimum.\u201d\nI feel that this price is outrageous considering that the only other photographer I have worked with charges $650 for 4 hours and provides me with around 200-300 edited photos. She keeps saying that she is doing me a favor and giving me a discounted rate, which I do appreciate and was one of the reasons why I agreed to hire her. Also, it is NOT at all my fault that there were two locations because her flash died and we had to stop! The amount of models and outfit changes were discussed!! \nMy problem is that if all of these factors were an issue with her, why not tell me in the moment? Why wait until after to express this when we talked about it beforehand? \nShe is stating that she will only give me 50 photos for the $600 I\u2019ve paid her. Considering all that has happened, is this fair? ",

I'm still a legal resident of California, but most of the business operations will be happening in Arizona during the school year, especially during the spring semester (I want to help make composites for the Greek Life orgs that are on campus who have shown interest). \n\nMy initial thought was to start an LLC, though with the insane friggin' filing fees and taxes in California, I've decided against that (unless there's a way to start one solely in Arizona which I don't believe there is based on my residency status.) A sole proprietorship seems like a lower cost option in this case, but I'd like to have a DBA associated with it to make it sound more professional, and I'm a bit confused on how to file for that in this situation.\n\nSince I'm a resident of California, could I simply file DBA paperwork in my home county and it would extend across state lines? Or would I need to only file in Arizona since that's the principal place of business (zero business would occur in California)? Or would I need to file DBA paperwork in both states regardless?\n\nSome assistance on the matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

With all of the chaos right now I am definitely concerned as I don\u2019t want a tax lien due to this new nonsense.\n\nEdit 1: I\u2019m digging myself out of the hole from previous tax years when I was barely making enough. I started my business by accident and it didn\u2019t really become profitable until 2020. Now, I have a CPA that helped me to file as S-Corp to lower the taxes further. I also have a payroll company to file quarterly taxes. I have already paid off 90K in taxes from previous years and now I am tackling as much of the current 72K balance before I have to file in April. What really killed me was the interest rate jumped from 4% to 8% in 2021. It\u2019s exhausting to keep up with all of this. The IRS phone system keeps kicking me off every time I have tried calling them. I can\u2019t even get to the part where I\u2019m on hold for an hour.",

            "description": "I was laid off a few months ago, the job market is a bit rough and I haven't been able to find a job yet. Since then I've considered starting a physical business near my home and being my own boss. I think some ideas that have come to mind are a pool hall, aquarium/pet store, coffee shop. But since I live in NYC, I would probably face a lot of competition and high rents. What's also hard is I have a mortgage on a house with a family and kids, so it would also be financially risky if it were to fail.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have a business background nor have worked in any of the industries I listed above. The pool hall would have the largest upfront costs but would generate lots of revenue over the long-term, the profits unfortunately would mostly be made from food and drinks...and at that point it's more like a restaurant if that is the case. I used to be into aquatic fishes and aquariums as a hobby when I was younger. There's a lot of young families in my neighborhood, but I'm not sure if there's a market for this compared to when I was younger when there were shops aquariums everywhere...I feel like most of the revenue would come from selling equipment and most people would rather buy online these days. I don't care about coffee, but I feel like a cafe would required the least overhead but also generate the least revenue.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with a brick & mortar business and/or have focus on the industries I mentioned above -- What's your experience? How long did it take you to become profitable? Did you have to market your business a lot or the customers came naturally? Did you take a loan or use your own savings?",

I have heard of:\n- Cliptalk Pro\n- Luma\n- Luma Dream Machine\n-  Invideo. \n\nHowever, the options are endless and I am quite overwhelmed with the options. Which ones do you guys recommend to create high quality authentic videos? Our target audience is a anywhere from 20-40s, and a more premium/ luxury market since our prices are not cheap. Hence we do not want to create any gimmick Gen Z videos. Any apps that can help us with script, creating realistic videos would be great. \n\nAlso in terms of posting strategy, what is the best frequency and types of content to post? \n\n- Would posting once a day be enough?\n- What kinds of hashtags should we be using in order to reach the audience ",

            "description": "Little background, I have an Ender-3 Pro and know how to use CAD (Fusion 360 certified, but use Onshape as it\u2019s free) and am a mechanic at my local bowling alley. I noticed we were running low on a part we go through quite a bit (high wear location for a plastic part) and decided to model and print it. Works better than some of the ones we order. This along with the goal of owning a business at some point in my life prompted me to start a business. Square is easy to use, and I already knew how to use it from the snack bar at work, which uses square, while the front desk uses Brunswick Vector+ Desk (part of scoring system). I set up square and got the free reader from them, and also set up Square Online. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m doing things right: I went in and set up taxes in square for every item to have a 6% tax (the rate for Kentucky), and it is to my understanding that Square REPORTS to the IRS, but I am unsure if it REMITS sales taxes. If they don\u2019t, then I need to learn when and how to file taxes. \n\nAdditionally, I am unsure of which forms I need to fill out, and when for my business. For reference, I do everything on my own, making it a sole proprietorship if I understand correctly, but have seen very mixed information on what I need to do. I am not currently registered to the state or city. My business is online, and for in person sales or services, I am mobile, not a fixed location. Any help would be very much appreciated!!\n\nTLDR; trying to start a business on Square selling 3D printed parts, and am unsure of forms, taxes, and structure",

However, I have a client now and am working on creating my first invoice.\n\nI am contractually required to show the actual hours of when I work. For example, I need the Invoice to show the units of an hour, I also need it to show for example if I worked Monday, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, with the actual date, description of what I did, and start/end times. \n\nBased on extensive searching, some other reddit post, and the current support ticket I have for FreshBooks, this is an impossible function. Which is odd, because I have Start/End Times enabled in FreshBooks. I also can't seem to export Time Entries with this data either. Which makes FreshBooks 90% a waste of money. \n\nIn one of my earlier reddit posts, Zoho was recommended, however it doesn't appear that Zoho has this functionality as well. \n\nLooking for suggestions. I expect nearly all of my contracts to have this contract requirement to show actual hours of when I work. \n\nBonus: All in one software for accounting is good preferred. \n\nThis has me in a bit of a frenzy as if the data is already there, why can't I get it into Invoice and (for me at least a Report). It also means that I wasted 300 dollars on a subscription that is effectively pointless.  I would appreciate any guidance on this matter.\n\n\nedit: Confirmed with FreshBooks support. What I am looking for is not feasible.",

            "description": "So I'm currently in the process of parting ways with my current job in which I was a sales representative selling cookware to small chain hispanic grocery stores/ mom and pop stores. I've been in this line of business for many years now and have made many connections.\n\n  \nI would like to begin wholesaling on a miniature scale due to my lack of funds. I just don't know what to sell. it would have to be something with a fast turnover rate and decently profitable but not too expensive because I have to continue paying bills out of the 10k that I have saved up.\n\n  \nI know I should ideally have more funds and I am in the process of looking for a new job in order to save up more money and build up my risk tolerance, but I want to use the time between now and then to try something out and see if it kicks off. I have a customer base and sales skills, just don't have a product. \n\n  \nI was thinking Pi\u00f1ata's but I think that would require more money upfront and I don't think it's something that sells quickly. Maybe it's something to hold off on until further down the line when I'm more established. \n\n  \nI also thought about coffee beans but there are a lot of regulations around consumables and I'd rather not get into that space unless I know it's going to be profitable. From what I've read online, though, coffee isn't very profitable. I'm going to do more research, though. \n\n  \nAlso, I have access to a warehouse where I can receive and store pallets and they regularly get shipments from Miami and Houston so if there is anything that needs to be shipped in from those areas, I can make it happen fairly easily. \n\n  \nIf anyone has any ideas, I would greatly appreciate it and sorry if it seems like my writing is all over the place, I have a lot on my mind right now. \n\n  \n",

            "description": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m looking for a side hustle and I think I found a niche I make sense in but I wanted to get feedback from small business owners.\n\nI working as a writer full time, but have a background in social media, photography, videography, and graphic design. I grew up on an island known for its historic charm that is filled with small businesses and antique stores. Most of these places don\u2019t have anything other than a Facebook account and half the time it hasn\u2019t been updated in years.\n\nI\u2019d like to offer my services as an on site social media coordinator. I would come to the store and get photos, videos, interviews, do educational reels about the history of certain items for sale or of the building the store is in, so vendor spotlights if it\u2019s an emporium style shop, etc. I\u2019d offer to edit and post on their Facebook and instagram accounts with the purpose of increasing their following and brand presence, while legitimizing their business as one that\u2019s important to preserving the history of the island (it\u2019s a big part of the culture).\n\nI\u2019d do an introductory offer of $300/month for three months and then increase to 500/month with discounts if you sign on for at least 6 months. There would be scheduled posts every day (this is one of my greatest talents, I can make something out of anything) and I\u2019d offer limited engagement with the audience as well.\n\nMany of the owners are older and might not understand the benefits a social media following can have on their business, so I was hoping to incentivize it in a way that translates easier to dollars gained. like if you\u2019re an emporium for example, you rent out a booth to a vendor and they pay a monthly fee, as the owner you incentivize people to rent a spot at your shop knowing that it comes with a social media coordinator that can help promote their business.\n\nThe island is also home to many museums and event rental spaces that don\u2019t have any social media presence, so I\u2019d also be interested in reaching out to those places but the fee structure would probably be different\u2026\n\nAs small business owners, is this something y\u2019all would see value in?\n\nP.S. even though I work full time as a writer, my company only expects me to work 15 or so hours a week (long story) so I have time to do this well.",

What makes you choose a specific service provider (trust, reviews, etc.) when using platforms like this?\n2. **Challenges**: What are some of the biggest challenges I might face when building and scaling a platform like this?\n3. **Monetization**: Any thoughts on how I can monetize this type of service marketplace (e.g., subscription, transaction fees, premium features)?\n4. **Building the Platform**: If you\u2019ve built a similar platform, what technology stack did you use? Any tools or frameworks you would recommend for building a seamless experience for both service providers and customers?\n5. **Attracting Service Providers and Users**: How can I ensure that the service providers are trustworthy and capable? What\u2019s the best approach to attracting both customers and service providers to a new platform?\n\nAny advice, resources, or experiences from similar projects would be greatly appreciated!

            "description": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIn my post on January 8, I wrote about how I struggle to speak the common language with business owners. Based on the feedback I received, I wanted to share one version of what I wrote to see if it better addresses business needs.\n\nAccounting professionals are notoriously bad at communication\u2014we prefer dealing with numbers rather than people. However, that approach doesn\u2019t work when you have a consulting service and need to find new clients.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! Please be kind and constructive in your comments. I know it\u2019s not perfect, but I also know I will never be an advertising genius. :)\n\nThank you!\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Why business owners call me**\n\nCEOs and founders reach out when they\u2019re struggling with cash flow unpredictability, hitting revenue plateaus, or losing time to back-office inefficiencies.\n\nThey know they need financial clarity, but they\u2019re too busy running the business to fix it themselves.\n\nI step in to bring order, create value, and optimize cash flow, so they can scale profitably\u2014without operational chaos.\n\n**2. Common struggles I solve**\n\nThe business owners I work with often deal with:\n\n\\- Unpredictable cash flow\u2014constantly guessing how much money they\u2019ll have in 3-6 months.\n\n\\- Slow invoicing & collections\u2014revenue trapped in unpaid invoices with no structured follow-up.\n\n\\-  Too much manual work\u2014wasting hours on financial admin instead of focusing on growth.\n\n\\- No financial visibility\u2014making big decisions without clear numbers on margins or costs.\n\n\\-  Missed financial opportunities\u2014overpaying taxes or losing money due to poor structuring.\n\n\\- Scaling challenges\u2014growing revenue but losing profits due to inefficiencies.\n\n**3. Who I work best with**\n\nI partner with founders, CEOs, and entrepreneurs who:\n\n\\- Are growing fast but feel overwhelmed by financial complexity.\n\n\\- Juggle too many roles and need a trusted advisor for clarity.\n\n\\- Want predictable cash flow instead of financial surprises.\n\n\\- Need a scalable financial structure that supports long-term growth.\n\n\\- Struggle with slow invoicing & collections and want to get paid faster.\n\n**4. What working together looks like**\n\n\\- Financial clarity in plain English\u2014understand your cash flow, margins, and costs without drowning in spreadsheets.\n\n\\- Automation & efficiency\u2014eliminate time-wasting financial tasks so you can focus on revenue.\n\n\\- Cash flow you can trust\u2014see 3, 6, and 12 months ahead so you\u2019re never caught off guard.\n\n\\- A back-office that scales\u2014so growth doesn\u2019t turn into operational chaos.\n\n**5. How to get started**\n\nWe start with a Cash Flow & Financial Health Assessment\u2014a quick analysis to identify immediate wins and long-term improvements.\n\n\ud83d\udce9 DM me here on LinkedIn or email me at ........................ to set up a no-risk, 20-minute conversation.",

            "description": "Hey everyone, I\u2019ve been thinking about a business idea and wanted to get some feedback. In many developing countries, job seekers struggle to find opportunities that match their skills, and employers have difficulty finding the right candidates. A lot of hiring still happens through word-of-mouth or outdated job boards, which leaves many qualified people unemployed or underemployed.\n\nDue to this opportunity for innovation, I think a tech-mobile-friendly platform would help bridge this gap, making it easier for job seekers and employers to connect. From what I\u2019ve seen, there\u2019s not much competition in my target market, and I have some local connections that could be useful if I move forward with this.\n\nOne key factor is that my target market has a highly youth-populated workforce, which could help drive adoption of a tech-friendly app over traditional hiring methods.\n\nDoes this sound like a viable idea? What challenges do you think I should consider before taking the next step? Would love to hear your thoughts!",

The BIA no longer shares anything I tag them in (but they share everyone else's stuff). \nAnd the tourism page has excluded me from their valentines directory and unfollowed my page.\nIt has me wondering why everyone dislikes me, when I haven't done anything wrong.\nI know no body here knows the answer to this, but just looking for insight or maybe similar experiences from other small business owners. \nI know that 2/3 of the florists listed on the directory find me as serious competition (even though I always send people their way if I don't have what they need) so maybe it's jealousy?\nAnd then otherwise I guess my question is, do people dislike others for being positive and kind?

Meaning you can pull it all back out at anytime. What you spend on micro transactions would also get you things like in game currency or a cosmetic or something so it\u2019s a win win. \n\nWhen you pull your money out because you\u2019ve saved up enough, you lose a lot of your in game progress (maybe NG+ scenario where you keep some stats) so it incentivizes you to keep saving. \n\nIf you you want to know more about the monetization model PM me and also let me know if this makes sense. I\u2019m thinking like retro 8-but adventure game style. I can also share the link to the kickstarter if y\u2019all want more info. ",

She keeps asking me if I am fired or what, and I have been telling her that the job is still there for her IF she wants to do the responsibilities given. employee says i am doing constructive discharge, and honestly im a small business owner and idk what is happening. I don't want to say that shes fired (because shes not) because she will file for unemployement. I dont know what to do and recently she has asked for my EIN and FEIN number and idk if i should give that to the employee. She probably is going to file some form or report or suit, so I am not sure what to do. Should i give her this info? or say no? I don't want more trouble.\n\n\n\nEdit: so basically, she's been giving me a lot of crap beforehand and not wanting to do some of the tasks that have been given and once additional compensation, and asks for leaves because she is sick, fell, ankle, sprain, etc. so when she had asked for 2 to 3 days off because she had a fever, I kind of lost it. I did not respond and did not put her on the schedule for the following two weeks. Ever since then I had text her and asked her if she wanted to the job responsibilities as given, and she had disagreed and from there, it has been a constant back-and-forth text regarding what she would like to do and what I would like her to do with what responsibilities. In the end, she's asking for my EIN and FEIN number possibly to file a claim for unemployment. She keeps asking me if she is fired and I do not want to give her a straight answer because she probably wants to file for unemployment. I have told her that the position is still there and she can come back anytime and fulfilled these responsibilities, but she said she does not want to and asks if she is fired numerous times.",

And honestly, it\u2019s not always about having the best product.\n\n# From what I\u2019ve seen, the ones that actually get sales do a few smart things:\n\n# \u00a0They make their photos feel more like Pinterest. No one really cares about a plain lamp on a white background. But show it in a cozy living room with warm lighting? That makes people want it.\n\n# Their descriptions actually create a vibe. Instead of just saying \u201csoft cotton throw blanket,\u201d they say, \u201cWrap yourself in this ultra-soft throw, perfect for chilly evenings.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you, but that sounds way more tempting.\n\n# They use better keywords. A \u201cboho macrame wall hanging\u201d and a \u201chandmade tapestry\u201d might be the same thing, but one probably gets way more searches than the other.\n\n# I feel like home decor is such a visual thing\u2014if you don\u2019t make people imagine it in their space, they just scroll past.\n\n# Has anyone else noticed this? Or if you sell home decor, what\u2019s worked (or not worked) for you? Just curious to hear from others!",

It's a bit over 2k a month for Google Ads and around 1k for SEO. They take 20% of the ad budget for management.\n\nMy website goes live this month. I'm nervous that I am going to throw away the rest of my startup budget into ads and never see a return.\n\n\\#- Does anyone with a local home service business have postive experiences using Google Ads?

Their team was constantly tied up answering the same customer questions pricing, availability, service details while also trying to schedule jobs and manage operations. Missed calls meant missed revenue.\n\nI wanted to see if a digital employee could solve this. So, I built a voice agent specifically for home services\u2014 ne that could instantly handle customer inquiries, answer FAQs, and assist with scheduling.\n\n# Case Study\n\nA growing home services company in Canada was struggling with high call volumes. Customers would call to ask about pricing, service areas, and availability, but many went unanswered, especially during peak hours. Hiring additional staff wasn\u2019t a cost-effective option.\n\n# Solution\n\nWith some help, they integrated a digital employee to:\n\n* Answer inbound calls 24/7\n* Provide instant responses to common questions (pricing, services, availability)\n* Assist customers with booking service appointments\n* Route urgent calls to live agents when needed\n* Send follow-up messages via SMS and email\n\n# Impact\n\nWithin the first week, they saw a 70**% reduction in missed calls** and improved customer satisfaction. By the end of 30 days, their team was spending less time answering repetitive questions and more time delivering quality service.\n\n# Results\n\n* Fewer missed calls and lost leads\n* Faster response times for customer inquiries\n* Reduced workload for staff, allowing them to focus on core operations\n* Increased bookings through automated call handling\n\nI\u2019ve set up a demo voice agent so you can see it in action: **+1 (507) 544 9675**\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, what industry do you think could benefit the most from this?",

            "description": "Tl;dr Current NW 6.5 million, looking for semi-passive income strategy so my partner can quit her job.\n\n* Currently live in Columbus Ohio\n* Have $6.5 million in stock in SpaceX (I was a previous employee many years ago)..\u00a0 They offer buy backs every 6 months.\u00a0 Valuation has been increasing steadily for several years.\u00a0 Recently the value went up 66% in 6 months.\u00a0 Some will probably be concerned that the majority of my net worth is tied up in one company, but I have no concerns about that.\u00a0 I\u2019ve held onto this equity since 2010 and it\u2019s done nothing but continue to go up.\u00a0 I expect stock value to go up between 15-40% by the end of the year - so it could be worth 7.6 - 9.2 million.\u00a0\n* Mortgage/tax monthly payment $3695 (30 year mortgage).\u00a0 House is valued at $672,800, purchased for $630k in 2022.\u00a0 Remaining balance is $466k.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n* We make about 275k combined.\n* I currently do contract work in the aerospace industry part time, but am looking to expand my business and dedicate myself to it full time, likely increasing the money I bring in.\n* My partner would like to work less and spend more time with the kids.\u00a0 I would like to do that eventually as well, but I intend on focusing on growing my consulting business until we reach a point financially where that\u2019s not needed.\n* I\u2019d like to find an investment strategy or business my partner and I can run that\u2019ll allow her to quit her current job.\u00a0 Hoping to find something that\u2019ll generate somewhere around 75K+ per year.\n* I\u2019m fine selling some stock to fund a business purchase if necessary.\u00a0\u00a0\n* We are both fine putting in a lot of work initially to get a business established, but would hope long term it\u2019d be a business that could be managed by others, allowing her to reduce her working hours to more of a part time type of arrangement.\u00a0\u00a0\n* I\u2019ve looked at businesses for sale, franchises, etc but not really sure what to look for.\u00a0 Columbus is the fastest growing city in the midwest, so there\u2019s enough people moving here and plans for large businesses to set up here.\u00a0 I feel like businesses that cater to the home services sector would likely do well.\u00a0 Also, Anduril is building a 5 million sq ft manufacturing facility in south columbus starting next year that\u2019s supposed to employ 4000 people.\u00a0 So, I\u2019d be curious how to take advantage of that - it\u2019ll likely draw people from other areas, avg salary for that facility will be 132k, real estate in that area isn\u2019t overpriced just yet.\u00a0 There\u2019s land and potential opportunity to set up businesses to serve those people.\u00a0 Would be interesting to see how to take advantage of that.\u00a0\n\nAny suggestions or comments would be awesome.\u00a0 \n\n",

Check out my latest video here \\[link\\] and let me know:\n\n* What would make it more engaging for kids?\n* Is the pacing ninja-fast or turtle-slow?\n* Any cool ideas for future videos?\n\nBonus points if you can spot the hidden ninja in the videos (spoiler: there isn't one, but now you'll watch extra carefully \ud83d\ude09)\n\nThanks in advance!

Why are these people spending so much time on emails, I don\u2019t get it.\n\nWell, most of them are just long and cluttered messages where they add important info halfway through the email and by the time you fully read it you are confused and have to double check or sometimes triple check it.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I built a tool to help summarize messages. I also realized I was going through those problems myself so I built Mailsalot to instantly sort out the important info from my emails and send me a concise summary so that I can focus on my real work.\n\nIf you\u2019re going through the same pain and don\u2019t want to spend another hour on emails then join our\u00a0[free beta group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/GyY5kmBUwmN8MxvEOQMABq)\u00a0where you\u2019ll get instant free access to our tool.\u00a0\n\nP.S.

            "description": "I've been a startup Founder since 1994 when I started my first company at 19.\u00a0 Since then I've started 9 companies and exited 5.\u00a0 The last exit was last year.\u00a0 I'm trying to provide some backstory without getting into who I am - you can dig into that on your own if you want, but it's not necessary.\n\n\u00a0I wanted to share what a life looks like when every time you can choose between \"The Safe Route\" and the \"Totally Stupid Idea\" ... you always pick the latter.\u00a0 I think part of this is because we all struggle with the \"What if...\" and often romanticize that outcome.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Here are some milestones where I had to make those choices, what I did, and how it turned out.\u00a0 Some of you are dealing with exactly these choices, so I want to provide some color from one point of view on how I thought about it.\n\n\u00a01. I dropped out of college\n\nLook, I sucked as a student, which is kind of ironic bc I'm basically paid to be a teacher. When I was 19, in 1994 I realized that this new thing called \"The Internet\" would be a big deal and I could charge companies money to build something called a \"Web Site\".\u00a0 When I told my guidance counselor that I was dropping out of school to start \"an Internet company\" she looked at my incredulously and said \"What's the Internet?!\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Needless to say she wasn't supportive of my decision.\u00a0 Nor was any other person in my life whatsoever.\u00a0 You have to remember that back then the idea of young Founders wasn't anything like it is today.\u00a0 I had no idea if this interactive agency thing had legs, I just knew that I hated school and was essentially unemployable.\u00a0 So I went all in.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The reason I think it worked isn't because the agency went on to be successful.\u00a0 It worked because I knew in my gut that working for someone else, or more specifically not having complete agency of my life (no matter what it paid) was all I really cared about.\u00a0 That ended up being the defining characteristic of my life thereafter.\u00a0 It was immutable, even though every voice around me told me otherwise.\n\n\u00a02. I left my own company before IPO\n\n\u00a0The agency I started go merged with another agency, I joined the board and served as the CEO of the interactive part and we grew that company to $700m in billings in 7 years.\u00a0 At that point we were prepping for an IPO.\u00a0 In 2001 we were approached by Dan Snyder (yes the Washington Commanders owner) to purchase the agency and we sold it in 2002 with the understanding that we'd take it public past the sale.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0At that point I had the option of working at the agency and going through the IPO or leaving altogether.\u00a0 I quit well before any of that happened.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 I hated working at an agency.\u00a0 It pays well, but service work is insanely thankless (if you do well, no one cares, if you fuck up, clients are all up your ass) and we were working with clients that paid well, but didn't inspire me.\u00a0 I was 27.\n\n\u00a0I left a LOT of money on the table.\u00a0 My business partner stayed on, took the company IPO, and made gobs of cash.\u00a0 What he endured to get it was insane, and I respect him so much.\u00a0 In the 20+ years since I have spent about 9 seconds worrying about whether or not I made the right decision.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I would have made more money, but I would have eaten up some of the most exciting years of my life (late 20s, early 30s) slaving for clients I didn't enjoy with a mission I simply didn't care about (btw, that's also unfair to everyone I worked with).\u00a0 I valued my freedom over the money, and looking back I realize it was an incredible win for my life, not so much my wallet ;)\n\n\u00a03. I clashed with VCs over running my company\n\n\u00a0This has a lot more backstory than I can offer here, but the short version is I seed funded my first (funded) startup with a bunch of well known backers like Bessemer, Founder's Fund, and notably in this case Mark Suster (before he became a VC, he personally invested).\u00a0 Mark was very adamant when we started the company (same concept as what Affirm is now, only years before them) that I only focus on this one thing, and nothing else.\n\n\u00a0He said that what good Founders do is focus on a single, funded opportunity and just pursue that.\u00a0 Did I follow Mark's advice?\u00a0 No - I did pretty much the opposite.\u00a0 Instead I started 4 other companies, 2 of which I self-funded and 2 of which I venture funded.\u00a0 It... did not go well with investors.\n\n\u00a0VCs are very used to have a large degree of control over their funded Founders and with me, they had none of this, and it really pissed them off.\u00a0 To be clear - that was MY fault, not theirs.\u00a0 I was kind, but I really don't like being told what to do (hence my career choice).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Because of that, and other reasons, we had very \"meh\" outcomes on all of the funded companies.\u00a0 No big losses, but no big wins.\u00a0 It was 100% my fault.\u00a0 Maybe had I focused on just one company like Mark said, it would have been more successful.\u00a0 Maybe not.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0But my goal was to build a portfolio of startups, because I wanted the agency to work on lots of things in parallel because that's where my heart and interest lies.\u00a0 What I learned from that experience, which actually helped me, was that I could still pursue that path (what I'm doing now) but I'd have to do it without investors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0It's kind hard to be in the startup game and not wonder whether or not we should have pursued investment.\u00a0 So I took both paths (some funded, some not) at the same time for over a decade (I would highly recommend this to no one) and learned through tears and panic attacks, that being a funded founder isn't for me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI know many of you have faced these same questions and challenges - I'm curious if you think your freedom was worth the sacrifice and what your criteria were.",

            "description": "For the last decade, I worked in the video game industry as a lead developer. It was my dream job\u2014something I wanted since I was a kid playing late into the night, imagining what it would be like to create worlds of my own. I started at a small studio, moved up fast, and eventually ended up working for one of the biggest companies in the industry. Long hours, crazy deadlines, and the pressure to constantly outdo ourselves\u2014it was intense, but I thrived on it.\n\nThen, two months ago, I got an offer I couldn\u2019t ignore: a buyout package. They were restructuring, and for the first time, I had the option to step away with financial security. I took it.\n\nYesterday was my first full day of not being a game dev. I slept in (no morning stand-up meetings), had a slow breakfast, and for the first time in years, played a game just for fun\u2014not to analyze mechanics or spot bugs. It felt weird. My brain kept waiting for a Slack notification that never came.\n\nI always thought I\u2019d be in this industry forever, but now\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019ll freelance, maybe I\u2019ll build something on my own, me and some friends made a community of people who make money off crypto coins together, we double our money pumping n dumping every week, it\u2019s too easy to make money nowadays there is no reason to be stressed at work in my opinion, and that goes for everyone. I can answer any questions you have. For the first time in a long time, I don\u2019t have a roadmap. And honestly? That might be the most exciting part.",
